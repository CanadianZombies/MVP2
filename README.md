# MVP2
A MUD project I assisted a friend with back in the day. This code is old and unused by myself. I presume it is no longer maintained.

This was developed by a friend of mine and I helped him fix up code where I could. I was not able to fully help with this project due to life circumstances.

This was the last full system he sent me post changes completed. This is a MUD.
