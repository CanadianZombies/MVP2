travelling through some hilly areas. You squint your eyes and look into the
distance, seeing nothing but barren land.

Name Bordering the Swamp~
Descr
The air is suddenly very moist, and a thin layer of fog begins to form. A
large pool of dirty water is before you, bubbling in some areas. Several
dead trees lay across the ground ahead of you, but they shouldn't be too
much of an obstacle.

The fog is getting thicker and thicker, and you are at the point where
you can't see more than 10 feet ahead of you. The swamp waters below you are
filled with garbage and debris. Being cautious as to where you step, you
slowly make your way deeper into the marsh.

It is like torture travelling through these wastelands. The fiery sun
above burns your flesh, and your feet simmer from contact with the dry,
cracked ground. You are beginning to dehydrate, and almost collapse while
travelling through some hilly areas. You squint your eyes and look into the
distance, seeing nothing but barren land.

This part of the wasteland is completely stripped of its lifeforms. You

another dead body on the ground.
