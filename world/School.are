her surface. It occurs to you that you might be able to climb up a faint,
narrow path, if only you had the right equipment.

This rocky cliff seems impassable, although not very high. It seems as if
the very earth itself has split in an attempt to remove this foul place from
her surface. It occurs to you that you might be able to climb up a faint,
narrow path, if only you had the right equipment.

Name A Rocky  Escarpment~
Descr
This rocky cliff seems impassable, although not very high. It seems as if
the very earth itself has split in an attempt to remove this foul place from
her surface. It occurs to you that you might be able to climb up a faint,
narrow path, if only you had the right equipment.
