Name Plane of Fire~
Descr
Fire shoots up from the ground everywhere. The stench of burning flesh
lingers in the air. To take a step could be almost certain death. However,
on the walls there is some ancient writings showing a civilized culture once
lived here, almost giving a false sense of safety.

Name Prison Cell~
Descr
These prison cells are padded with a thick lining, almost as if the
prisoners where insane. The doors are locked very tightly so prisoners may
not attempt an escape. The room is dark with just a faint light shining
through a small hole where it seems the guards put the prisoners food
through, allthough no guards are anywhere in sight.

Name Field of Sin~
Descr
This field was once know for it's ultimate sin parties, but has now
turned into more of a graveyard. The sinners where taken over by their own
demons and destroyed because of it. The room is small yet seemingly
comfortable. There are markings on the wall that look like pictures of a
once great place. These pictures are old and quite faint. The floor seems
uneven almost as if it could disapear at a moments notice.

These prison cells are padded with a thick lining, almost as if the
prisoners where insane. The doors are locked very tightly so prisoners may
not attempt an escape. The room is dark with just a faint light shining
through a small hole where it seems the guards put the prisoners food
through, allthough no guards are anywhere in sight.

These prison cells are padded with a thick lining, almost as if the
prisoners where insane. The doors are locked very tightly so prisoners may
not attempt an escape. The room is dark with just a faint light shining
through a small hole where it seems the guards put the prisoners food
through, allthough no guards are anywhere in sight.
