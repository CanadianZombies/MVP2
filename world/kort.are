like this, it all looks so similar.  The outer wall is made of that strange
metal-like stone that you saw in the balcony, it would probably make a very
nice blade, except it is very rigid and strong, most likely too rough to be
forged.  The smell of death is making you sickley.

Name Balcony of the Theater~
Descr
You are now walking on what appears to be the balcony of the theater.  It
seems strange to have a balcony above the ceiling, but you realize that
something has to hold the corpses.  The smell is atroucious and feelings of
disgust rage in your soul.  The vampires that are here seem more arrogant
than the ones below, but they must have a reason.  The balcony is crafted
from an ancient stone which you cannot identify.

Name In the Rafters of Ceiling~
Descr
You are in the rafters of the ceiling now, you see many vampireshere
also.  There are many poles in you way, this is imparing you vision a little
bit.  It is amazing how someone could find their direction sense in a place
like this, it all looks so similar.  The outer wall is made of that strange
metal-like stone that you saw in the balcony, it would probably make a very
nice blade, except it is very rigid and strong, most likely too rough to be
forged.  The smell of death is making you sickley.
