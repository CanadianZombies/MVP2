Over 2 eons ago the Kingdom of Yor stood above the very spot


you are on.  The fame and fortune of this kingdom spread throughout


the land and there was a great period of peace.  However, one day a


messenger from the Westlands came to the Kingdom of Yor to offer


his King's allegiance to the goodly King of Yor.  The goodly King


not realizing there was evil in the King of the West's heart agreed


to the allegiance with the idea of uniting the west and the east


into one vast world of brotherhood.


 


Upon the meeting between the two kings in the Kingdom of Yor, the


two kings clasped hands and a sudden glowing force began to expand


from the King of the West.  Suddenly, there was a vast explosion


which utterly destroyed the surrounding lands and left a deep scar


in the hearts and in the lands of the people of the East.  Trent,


the God of the East, upon hearing of this terrible destruction, came


to the location of the horrible explosion.  After examining the blast


site, he determined that Lonath had his hand in this evil plot.


To prevent further harm to the people of Yor (living and dead)


Trent sealed the entire area underground.


 


If you are reading this sign, the ancient spell protecting the


catacombs must be crumbling.  If you are from the East, beware,


because the crumbling of the spells of protection may have turned


the denizens of this ancient city mad and they may attack anyone in


their way. If you are from the West, be DAMNED for your intrusion,


and may the wrath of Trent hound you into your grave.

Name A Hidden Alcove~
Descr
You are in an underground shelter which seems to house a religious
nutcase. You see a bloody altar with what looks like rat bones all over the
place. There are also glowing runes carved into the walls. You get a very
sickly feeling as the air suddenly gets much cooler. All of a sudden you see
a blinding flash, and in steps an ancient figure.

blast. They seem to have become a farming community. You have a sudden
feeling of peace.

You notice this area is much brighter than other areas you've just walked
through. The fungus which provides the light is so abundant in these caverns
that it is as bright as daylight. You see a few farmers tending their crops,
and you suddenly realize there were some living survivors of the ancient
blast. They seem to have become a farming community. You have a sudden
feeling of peace.

Name In The Farmlands Of Yor~
Descr
You notice this area is much brighter than other areas you've just walked
through. The fungus which provides the light is so abundant in these caverns
that it is as bright as daylight. You see a few farmers tending their crops,
and you suddenly realize there were some living survivors of the ancient
blast. They seem to have become a farming community. You have a sudden
feeling of peace.

Name The Temple Of Sabelis~
Descr
You walk into what is evidently the high priest's chambers. You see the
priest kneeling obviously deep in prayer. Looking around the room, you
notice that the furnishings are quite modest. It is evident that Trent
believes that his priesthood maintain a level of luxury very much like the
people to which they preach.

Name The Temple Of Kilith~
Descr
You have entered the chambers of the high priest of Kilith. You notice
the high priest is sleeping on his bed, and you suddenly feel quite ashamed
for having possibly disturbed his sleep. You start to head out when you spy
what appears to be an apparition floating above the priest - and now its
gone. Your palms are starting to sweat. You aren't sure if its very smart to
remain here much longer.

Name Ruins Of The Temple Of Grumble~
Descr
You walk into what used to be the priest's living quarters. Sitting in
the corner of the room is what appears to be a completely brutalized soul.
You look a little closer and realize that his skin seems to be afflicted
with some hideous disease which makes the skin rupture and bleed, yet
somehow it heals only moments later to rupture elsewhere. The man is
writhing in agony.

You are in the modest shrine to the god of the East. You see from the
well used pews and the burning torches in the building that this shrine is a
frequent gathering place for the people of Yor. A wholesome peace permeates
the air in here and you get a sudden feeling of happiness. You almost feel
yourself smile.

Name Ruins Of The Temple Of Grumble~
Descr
You feel a chill go up your spine as you realize you are probably the
first person who has walked into this temple in centuries. This is obvious
from the cobwebs and dust everywhere. Long ago, all the pews in this temple
were chopped to pieces, and the altar lays broken in half from a mighty
blow. You suddenly notice along the edges of one of the walls what seems to
be tiny footprints. Your heart starts thumping in your head as you sense
danger ahead.

You notice this area is much brighter than other areas you've just walked
through. The fungus which provides the light is so abundant in these caverns
that it is as bright as daylight. You see a few farmers tending their crops,
and you suddenly realize there were some living survivors of the ancient
blast. They seem to have become a farming community. You have a sudden
feeling of peace.
