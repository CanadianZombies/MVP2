{R}                           New Player Help File
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}

{N}Welcome to {B}Midpoint Void 2{N}/{R}Void of Reality The New Beginning.{N}

In this help file we will explain some of the basic commands to help you get
started on the mud. This mud might be very different from other muds you have 
played. Why you may as. What are the differences?

We have 2 different alignments Good (whities) and Evil (darkies).
Each alignment has its own chats. Chat, raid, and  act <auction>.
You may need to be of certin level to use some of these channels. 
Chat everyone has. Once you have gained enough levels there is also
an X-Chat which is an across alignment chat.

Q. Can you have Multiple characters?
A. No! If you are caught with two players one will be deleted. I check logs daily
       And if I see that a player has a lot of new warpoints I will look for any
       signs of cheating. We have an on mud logsearch. We will find out.

To help you out with what differs mobs and players and objects in rooms. 
I will put them below as if you were looking in a room.

Example of a mob:
{C}A high elf stand here to protect the newbie area. {G}(Sanctuary){N}

Example of a same alignment player:
{P}Kilith is standing here.{N}
{P}Sabelis is flying. {G}(Sanctuary){N}

Example of an Opposite alignment player:
{P}+* A High-elf *+ is flying.{N}
{P}+* A Wild-Elf *+ is here.{N}

Object on the ground:
{c}a old rusty sword lies on the ground.{N}

{B}Basic Commands{N}:
{G}CONSIDER{N}               - Use consider when you are thinking about killing a mob.
                         This will help you see if the mob will kill you or not.
{G}KILL <MOB/PLAYER>{N}      - This will make you attack a mob or player.
{G}LOOK{N}                   - This command just makes you see what is in a room.
{G}WHO{N}                    - This will show you who is on the mud. - Level 15
                         Why is it level 15? So that no one can roll and cheat and
                         see who is on the other side.
{G}LEARN{N}                  - When you are at a teacher type learn to see what they teach
{G}LEARN <SKILL/SPELL>{N}    - This will make you learn the skill or spell
{G}PRACTICE     {N}          - This works with learn. This will help you become more
                         proficient in your spell or skill.
{G}PRACTICE <SKILL/SPELL>{N} - This will raise your skill level on skills
                         and on spells.
{G}CHAT  {N}                 - Lets you talk to players on your alignment side.
{G}PRAY   {N}                - It is a way for you to talk with immortals without everyone
                         on your side hearing you talk to us.
{G}FOLLOW <players name>{N}  - This command is how you follow another player of your alignment.
{G}SPAM     {N}              - What this command does is change how things in rooms look.
type spam to toggle through    Like players with affects. 
                               SPAM
                               A high elf stand here to protect the newbie area.
                               ...skin hard as stone.

{N}I also added the max for each type of armor I want to try for each

{Y}REMEMBER WHEN DOING WHITE IN YOUR WEAPON OR ARMOR COLORS USE $N$7 IF YOU
DO NOT USE $N$7 FOR SOME PLAYERS THE WHITE YOU MIGHT SEE WILL BE GREEN TO
OTHERS. THE PRIMARY COLOR FOR TEXT ON ZMUD IS GREEN. THE PRIMARY COLOR FOR
TELNET, WINTIN, AND SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE ANSI SO TEXT IS WHITE.
SO TO MAKE THIS:{N}(I SHOULD ADD FOR BRIGHT WHITE.... HEH NOT MUCH
DIFFERENCE.... USE $B$7.)
{R}Please also remember that at the end of each item put a $N. If you do not add this
all of us admins will be fixing all your bleeding ansi and that is not fun to do
if you have alot of color in your item.

Duribility is your v6 and v7 Make sure v6 is one of these numbers compared to what
type of Metal you have used. v7 should at least be a 1, if it is a 0 the item will be
broken and can not be fixed. v7 should usally be the same as v6 but does not have to be
as long as v7 is > 0. Also put the type of metal you picked out to you
in the name part of your item. AKA you have a Breastplate of Anger. You made 
the breastplate out of silver on this table. Make sure you put NAME SILVER BREASTPLATE
OF ANGER in your name field.
If the armor is none magical then use these values. If the armor is
magical as in glow or hum... Then you can suptract 2 from weight and
can add 1 to armor rating. So like for body armor that is Iron and magical
weight would be 8 and armor rating would go from 6 to 7.

{R}NUMBER ONE RULE IF IS YOU DELETE YOU DO NOT GET A REIMBURSEMENT!
{N}If you get killed and delete out of anger that is your choice. The best
thing to do when you get angry is to log off take some time. Then from
there log back on after cooling off. Log on after cooling off and rebuild
your kit from friends and popping eq. EQ is easy to get the levels and
remorts are not.

{R}NUMBER TWO RULE:
{N}You can not delete if you have gained one remort. You must ask an admin
to lower your remorts to zero to delete. This is to prevent pk death deletions.

For right now:

{B}Weapon damages allowed:
{N}1d1 1d2 1d3 1d4 1d5 1d6 1d7 1d8 1d9 1d10 {R}Nothing over 1d10!!!

9d1 9d2 9d3
10d1 10d2

{R}NO ITEMS EXCEED THIS!!!!

{G}On homeland mobs (level 1-65):{N}
No weapon will go over the max of 10 damage. 1d10 2d5 5d2 10d2

{R}On mobs from level 66-101{N}
Weapon damage range from 11-18. 2d8 8d2 2d9 9d2 18d1 1d18 3d5 5d3 ect...

{C}On ELITE MOBS!!! level 102-200:{N}
Weapon damage can range from 19-25 

{R}Warning not many of these weapons will be in the mud!! To make a weapon
of this damage you must ask Kilith for permission!!!{N}

{B}GEMS!!!{N}

{R}No GEMS{N} are to be created unless you have asked for permission from
Kilith. Any {R}GEMS{N} found will be deleted if made with out my OK. 
If you want a gem made. Make the gem, tell me the vnum, type of mana and I will make it.

{R}NO CHEATER EQ WHAT SO EVER!!! If you make it you will be punished.{N}
1st offence builder forzen one day!
2nd offence builder loss of levels (if you are 103 baned from mud one day)
{N}3rd offence builder deleted and area removed from the mud.

{B}Armor APB max will be +1 on all eq wear locations.{N} We have 25 wear
locations, so that will be a max of 25 APB on all your EQ! IF YOU MAKE APB
EQ YOU MUST PUT IN THE NAME OF THE ITEM APB so we can search for APB items
with OFIND APB.{N}

{B}PLUS STAT ITEMS: 
{R}There is to be NO PLUS STAT ITEMS IN THE GAME WHAT SO EVER!{N}

{B}Alignments on mobs:{N}
With the playing of alignments on mobs I have noticed:
from {R}-120 to -130{N} would raise someone of {B}good alignment {R}1{N} point.
from {R}-140 to -200{N} would raise someone of {B}good alignment {R}2{N} points.
from {R}-210 to -999{N} would raise someone of {B}good alignment {R}3{N} points.

The way this works is a good aligned mob will lower the alignment of a
good aligned player. So if the mob has 500 alignment that player will go
from 1000 alignment to 997 alignment. If they kill a mob with the
alignment of -500 they would then raise 3 points from 997 to 1000 once
again. If you have any questions on what the alignments should be on your
mobs ask an admin.
 

We are going to be talking about eq max, weapon max, mob max all week. so
watch for the max on this stuff in the next few days.

Level 101 Will be the top xp mob level no other XP mob will be over 101.
Exceptions for this level restriction are:
Mobs that load Powerful eq or weapons.
I will check the mobs that will load eq and depending on the eq will
I except if the mob is to buff/ just right/ or to weak.

Your xp mobs are to your decision...
{R}*by no means are any 86+ mobs in home lands* homeland xp will not
be easy no more then a max of around 10 to 20 85 level mobs in home lands.*{g}

{R}*DO NOT ADJUST EXP ON MOBS BY NO MEANS!!!*{g}

you {G}CAN{g} adjust {G}HP{g} to make it higher but not lower!
to adjust hp type hp <numb> ok hp 10 is normal hp. hp 15 is 1.5 times normal hp
it can go upto a max of 30... {R}please don't use 30 will take people forever to
kill the mob.{g}

{G}*Alignment*{g} Please set the alignment on mobs... if the mob is of {B}good alignment
set alignment to 300 to 700{g}

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
To setup a bg is very easy.

See if the who list looks some whateven... if not put a crappy item for prize

All you do is type:

setlevel <level range of 1-90> <prize vnum> <prize vnum>

So

setlevel 1 90 37 37

levels are lvl 1 - 90 and prize is object 37 or a loaf of bread

A prerequisite is a skill that you must be proficient in before the

what prerequisites are required to learn that spell/skill.  You must have
moderate to good proficiency in a prerequisite (50% success level).

The battleground is a 20 square area where you can fight against anyone
in the area with no equipment or experience loss.  Often, a prize will be
awarded to the player left standing when everyone else has died.  Type
battleground to sign up for the battleground once a god announces that it
will begin shortly.

If you win a BG you might gain either 1 or 2 prizes and you will 
gain 5 warpoints.

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}

Ratings are based on tons of things:  from the average damage you do to
your stats, to how many times you have died, to if you are on the topten, to
how many and what skills and spells you know.. the algo follows:

rating = ((100-armor_class)/3) + Total_of_all_stats +
         (average_weapon_dam * 5) + (max_hps / 40) +
         (30 points if on topten) + (max_mana / 5) + (level * 1.5) +
         (parry_percent / 18) + (dodge_percent / 18) + (hitroll / 4) +
         (damage_bonus) - (total_deaths / 2)

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
The arena is a place where any two players can duke it out without worrying
about exp loss or equipment loss from death.  When one player wins, both
players will be transported back to where they were, with their full amount
of hit points.  You may bet on the fights before they begin by typing
bet # <amount> (see help bet for more info or type bet alone for more
options).  Winnings are proportionate to how much you bet... if you bet
1 coin, and the odds are 2 to 1, you will only win 2 coins back.  If you
bid 5000, you will get a bigger chunk of the pool or every bidders' money,
but it may not be a big increase if you did not bid much.  No money is
created; the total money is simply split between the winners depending
on how much they bet.

To configure challenges on/off or arena spam on/middle/off, use config
Arena and config Challenge.  Type Config alone to see how.

is the number of COPPER coins and # is the person you are betting on
(when the fighters are set, it will say fighter #1 <name> and fighter #2
<name>)  # can only be 1 or 2.  If you lose the bet, you will not get any
money back, and it will notify you that your fighter has lost.  If you
win, the total pool of money of the winners and losers will be divided by
the winners.  If you are a fighter, you MUST bet on yourself if you want
to get some money.. and no, you can't bet on the other guy :P
Note: All money comes out/goes into your bank account.

add a certain amount of warpoints, depending on their level.  If
you are one of the top ten killers in the lands, then your name will
go on the topten list (view topten list by typing topten).  As a top
killer, you do not recieve anything special per se, except perhaps
the respect and fear of other players.  The difference between
killpoints and warpoints is that warpoints represent player kills,

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
PAST:
	In the days before history itself, back in the days of the 
ancients, thegreat men of magic ruled the world.  One power hungry 
mage by the nameof Bythus soon declared himself leader by banishing 
seven good ancients intothe netherworld, with one incredible spell.  
As Bythus' power grew, he beganu sing slaves to build a great city.  
Bythar was founded as the first city as a tribute to the great tyrant 
Bythus.  Soon after, the remaining good mages began to fear Bythus 
and did all they could to banish him, but to no avail.  The leader 
of this movement, Kryalis, was turned into a ghost and is rumored 
to still haunt the ancient areas of Bythar that exist today.  Bythus 
created orcs and dark elves as his minions with the help of the dark 
lord, Krag, in order to destroy the opposing ancients. However, in a 
final attempt to stop the imposing doom upon the world, the ancients 
joined together to reign destruction upon the city of Bythar. By an 
incredible fluke of nature, Bythus happened to be sleeping in his
private home in Bythar at the time, and was crushed under the slave-girl
he was sleeping with at the time (and about 10 tons of stone, too).

	Soon after, the remaining ancients built the great city of Xylar 
upon the ancient ruins where Bythar had been.  Before its completion, the 
massive hordes of orcs and magic-throwing dark elves, led by Krag himself, 
charged into the city, slaughtering all in their path.  Krag personally 
snapped the neck of every ancient that stood to defend the city, and in 
no time the city was again in ruins.  Krag became sick of the pleasant flowers
and grasses that seemed to grow wild around the ruins of Xylar, and began
to fear whatever or whoever controlled nature itself, and left back to the 
caves of Masqe with his great horde. 

 However, on his way back, a woman dressed in pure white robes walked slowly 
towards him, staring at him with an intense gaze.  Krag struck the woman down 
with his great staff, but not one second after he had smashed her to the ground, 
his staff turned into a massive serpent and swallowed Krag whole.  With the great 
magic of the world apparently dead, all that was left of magic in the world were 
the few disciples of the ancients and a few stray dark elves.  Legends say that 
the only true powerful magic resides in a strange dimension mortals call Midpoint Void.  
Since the great disappearance of magic, no one has reached the power or understanding 
that the ancient beings of old had wielded, and the land continues to be ruled
by the sword until the one true prophet comes from the midpoint void, and restores 
the ancients' name and magic.

        The world was at peace for 200 years without the gift of magic to corrupt 
the souls of the mortal realm, the world lived by the sword. Until one day, when 
the city of Xylar began to grow dimmer, and the aura that once surrounded the 
city began to fade away. The rumors of a great force beneath the streets of Xylar 
once again became the talk of the world. Then one day, a dark mist fell upon
the city of Xylar totally hiding it from view. The towers of Xylar that use to 
be visible from anywhere in the world were now gone without a trace.
       
	 Rumors that Bythus was awake filled the mortal world with fear. So 
once again the descendants of the seven ancients gathered together to bind 
Bythus beneath the city. However, the use of magic had long been forgotten 
and Bythus simply killed each ancient one by one. Destroying cities, and 
rearranging the world into his New Kingdom. Asmovia, from the city of Marabella 
was the last descendant of the ancients and thus Bythus wanted her dead.  
Bythus summoned her to his castle in Xylar and released all of his hatred upon her.  
In the last moments of her life, she called upon all of forces of nature and
life to summon all the magical powers surrounding New Xylar and bound it to one room... 
The Void of Reality. Throughout the world everyone could hear her death cry as the 
mist slowly lifted and the sun slowly set... Magic was again released into the world. 
The beliefs of legends were brought back through ancestral storytelling and books that 
were passed on. The gods once again came back into belief as this old civilization 
grew once again. The land was devastated, but the towns were built in the areas less
radiated and kings and barrens rule this now destroyed land. The Once great 
Midpoint Void lives to be found again by the mortals, and the mortals still await the 
day they can defeat Bythus and avenge the 7 ancients who delivered them from their 
suffering.

	Not more then a 300 years later, Bythus released himself from the 
Void of Reality. Xylar was in total shock to find out that Bythus once again 
wandered the world. Not more then a few days after the news of the escape of Bythus, 
Xylar was once again surrounded in a dark mist. This time the world knew of magic
and knew how to use this power. Many wizards grouped up to cast a spell to once and 
for all destroy Bythus. After the spell was cast the world seem to change. The spell 
that the wizards cast to destroy Bythus did just that, but it also destroyed the 
known world. Most of Xylar lay in ruins most under a great ocean. Masque and the 
mountain it was built into was almost totally destroyed and now lays in ruins. The 
ghosts of the population of masque have been heard to still inhabit it. The world 
has now begun to rebuild itself. The struggle of good verses evil continues till 
this day with the use of power and magic. Evil will not rest until the death of 
Bythus has been avenged. So this beings us to the Void of Reality the New Beginning!

On Midpoint Void, good and evil are at war.  Most evil creatures have
been banished from the earth, however there are still some who follow the
ways of evil.  If you are good and you encounter an evil player, you will
not see thier name.  You will simply see +* An Evil xxxx *+ (xxxx being
the race name).  It goes exactly the same for an evil person looking at a
good person.  Guards in good cities kill evil, and guards in evil cities
kill good.  It is an all-out war... Invasions by large groups are
possible.  You are not allowed to group with players of opposite
alignment.  Due to difficulty reasons, neutral players are treated like
they are "good" until they become totally evil.  Player killing between
good and evil results in HUGE amount of experience (depending on the
player level).  Good and evil players do not share the same channels of
communication, but good and evil players both hear YELLS (while in same
zone).  If you become evil while you are in a good town, you either have
to 1. run past the guards or 2. get good again.  If you become evil/good
you will start in the corresponding starting rooms for good/evil.  (IE,
an evil dwarf will go to the evil caves when he dies).  Orcs and
Darkelves can never become good.  That's all for now :P

of healing. Due to the schooling of war paladins healing spells are 
lower then that of a healer and due to the schooling to learn how to

a combat skill that allows you to flail about madly in a wild flurry.  
Because of the extreme energies required to go berserk like this, you 
will end up losing many stamina points.  So...  if you are planning to 
run after the battle, this is not a good option.  Anyone can flurry with

levels kick is next to useless, at high levels it can be invaluable.

It is impossible to kick ghosts or flying opponents for obvious reasons.

Syntax: bash <victim> or in combat, just bash

This skill allows you to attempt to push an opponent backwards forcefully
and rapidly, causing them to fall to the ground.  If successful, the
victim will not be able to attack for 2-4 rounds (only defend).

NOTE: Also, it is obviously futile to bash a dragon or a ghost.

Success of bashing is based on how well you have practiced bash, your
strength, and the victim's dexterity and dodge ability.
NOTE: With this skill it is possible that you fall on top of your victim,
in which case you will begin to groundfight, so IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
GROUNDFIGHTING AT ALL COSTS, DON'T BASH!!!!

difficult to tackle an opponent even if your dexterity is high.  If you
fail the tackle, you will be off-balance for the next 3-4 rounds, so if
you are planning on fleeing soon, it is not wise to tackle.

This spell creates a ball of light that will float nearby your head
if you wish it to.  The bright ball of light will illuminate most dark
rooms, providing a daylight-like atmosphere to the surroundings.  The
ball of light fades eventually, but it is rumored that its length of
existence is based on the level of the caster.

due to its simple casting procedures.  This spell was a favorite among

This skill allows you to sneak around an opponent and place a suitable

fighting someone else (IE you must be assisting someone else).

A word of caution: often the opponent will get angry and turn and attack
you after a successful circle.

Just like Backstab a Thief will circle for a greater ammount then a
Marauder because Marauders spent time learning warrior skills along
with learning their thief skills.

0 ARMORCLASS AC 'ARMOR CLASS'~
Armors like breastplates, helmets and various protective spells can
all be used to lower your "Armor" value.  The more armored you are,
the more damage can be "absorbed" from an attack.  If you are well-
enough armored, many attacks will not even reach your skin, and will
just give you a small bruise.  Armor is not a 100% surefire way to
stop all attacks, though; often an opponent will be able to find an
opening on even a person with incredible armor and the armor may absorb
little or none of the blow.

Spell cast messages

Spell cast messages use the following variables:

$N (substitutes the name of the VICTIM.. the person upon whom the spell is being cast).
$n (substitutes the name of the PERSON...the caster).
$M (substitutes him/her/it for the VICTIM)
$m (substitutes him/her/it for the CASTER)
$S (substitutes he/she/it for the VICTIM)
$s (substitutes he/she/it for the CASTER)

TO_CHAR1 <string>	This is shown to the character casting the spell.
TO_CHAR2 <string>	This is also shown to the character casting the spell.
			Example: You heal $N!
			or.....Your strength spell was a success....
TO_VICT1 <string>	This is shown to the victim of the spell, or
TO_VICT2 <string>	whom you are casting it upon.
			Example: $n heals you!
			or...You feel stronger!
TO_NOTVICT1 <string>	This is shown to the peope in the room who aren't
TO_NOTVICT1 <string>	the caster or the victim.
			Example: $n heals $N!
			or......$N's muscles bulge with increased power!

LINK <snum>	This command can be used to link a spell with another spell
		number.  For instance, if I want a spell to damage a victim
		and also heal the caster, I would have my damage spell LINK
		to the number of my heal spell.  Thus, heal would be cast
		every time this damage spell is cast....you get the idea :)
~

0 LINKLESS 'BAD LINK'~
Just so we don't get any complaints, we will warn you now:  Linkless
characters are VERY vunerable and can be taken advantage of easily!  If
you are being hunted by orcs, you cannot simply drop link; you will
remain linkless and they will be able to hit/attack you.  You will,
however flee when you become linkless and get attacked.  This prevents
cheating (being hunted or dropping link near death).  If you drop link
and die; TOUGH LUCK!  Wine, complain if you wish, but we warned you and
you will recieve NO help or reimbursement whatsoever.

The policy is simple: If you drop link and die; too bad.  We're truly
sorry for you, but no action will be taken.
~

0 CRASHES CRASH~
Crashes happen occasionally (about once every 5-8 hours at the moment).
Save every 3-5 minutes or after you kill a big mob or do a trade.
Be assured that when you die, your corpse is saved to disk and even
if a crash occurs your corpse will still be where you died.

NO REIMBURSEMENTS WILL BE GIVEN FOR CRASHES AT BAD TIMES!  PERIOD.

103 reset~
{B}{B}[{G}+{B}]-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{B}[{G}+{B}]
                                {R}RESET
{B}{B}[{G}+{B}]-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{B}[{G}+{B}]

This is the help file for setting resets in rooms for mobs and objects.
I will try and make this as simple as possible but if you have any question
on setting resets do not be afraid to ask.

MOB Syntax: reset <reset #> mob <mob vnum> <% mob repops> <number in room>
OBJ Syntax: reset <reset #> obj <obj vnum> <location> <% obj repops on mob>

Make it easy on yourself and make all mobs reset at 100% and load only
1 mob in a room of that kind.

Ok when you create a mob you will need to reset the mob in a room so it
will repop when the area repops. If you are going to load an item in a room
like as in a fountain, a box, or a portal the resets are just a bit different.

For and item in a room like a fountain:
reset 1 obj <vnum of fountain or other object> room <% of items load>

To load a weapon, armor, key, gem on a mob you must make sure the mobs reset
number is before the objects reset number

If you type:

reset 2 mob 4432 100 1

it should look like this when done

{G}2{g} - {g}Loads a {G}golden statue of Razlin {g}({C}4432{g}) in room (max {G}1 {g}at {G}100%{g} chance

Reason it is reset 2 is because there is a portal loading in the room first which is setup like this:

reset 1 obj 4378 room 100

Should look like this when you type reset:

{G}1{g}-  Loads {B}b{b}l{B}u{b}e {W}glowing {g}portal ({G}4378{g}) in room {R}100%{g} chance

There is also an item loading on the mob to reset that would be:

reset 3 obj 4432 none 100

Should look like this when you type reset:

{G}3{g}-  Loads a {Y}b{y}r{Y}a{y}c{Y}e{y}r{g} of the {B}g{b}o{B}d{b}s {g}({G}4432{g}) on {C}none {g}of {G}a golden statue of Razlin 
{R}5% {g}chance

So when you type reset in the room you would see a total of three resets looking like this:

{G}1{g}-  Loads {B}b{b}l{B}u{b}e {W}glowing {g}portal ({G}4378{g}) in room {R}100%{g} chance{G}
{G}2{g} - Loads a {G}golden statue of Razlin {g}({C}4432{g}) in room (max {G}1 {g}at {G}100%{g} chance
{G}3{g}-  Loads a {Y}b{y}r{Y}a{y}c{Y}e{y}r{g} of the {B}g{b}o{B}d{b}s {g}({G}4432{g}) on {C}none {g}of {G}a golden statue of Razlin
{R}5% {g}chance


This is a list of <location> keywords for the RESET command for objects.

lfinger         shield
rfinger         about                     You may sheath 2 weapons

much.

NOTE: GUILDMASTERS and PRACTITIONERS are NOT the same!  You cannot join
for instance, the warrior's guild at the WARRIOR practitioner!

If you've never taken a history class or have forgotten:  Guilds are
groups of skilled laborers/professionals that get together and basically
form a monopoly on the business/skill level.  Guilds are not secret,
tightly knit groups (see CLANS), but they are just members of people who
share common interests.

You can find help on each guild by typing HELP <guildname> like HELP WARRIOR.  
When you join a guild, you gain certain advantages depending on what the guild
specializes in.  For instance, tinkers pay less to repair goods, clerics'
guildmembers' spells are more powerful than those not in the guild,
warriors fight a little bit better, etc...  Guild members can be total
enemies, good friends or total strangers; it doesn't matter.  If you are
in a guild, it simply means you are a specialist in the guild's area (and
have gone through their training program).  When you join a guild, you

{c}Clans are tightly-woven social groups that stick together through thick
and thin.  A clan usually has a leader, which can organize meetings,
broadcast messages to fellow clan-members and organize raids/hunting
parties.  Being in a clan has no statistical advantages to your
character, although clan-members generally look after one another.  Once
you are in a clan, you are a member until kicked out by vote or you
switch alignments and the clan does not approve.  Each clan has their own
special channel for communication, and a notify beeper.  A notify message
appears whenever a clan-member raises a level, gets killed, or kills
another player.  For all you college people: a clan is like being in a
fraternity or sorority.  For info on the clan you are in (if any) type {R}CLAN

Syntax: alias      (shows your current aliases)
Syntax: alias <characters> <does-this>
Syntax: alias <name of alias>     (deletes the alias)

A '*' character in an alias will be considered as if you pressed enter.

Example: alias rs rest       -will make you rest after you  type: rs <enter>
Example: alias yum get bread*eat bread*smile
Example: alias k kill

Aliases are used so you don't have to type so much.  It also enables you
to do multiple tasks such as: backstab, flee, run south.

-Note: if you give an argument to the alias, it will use it as an argument
       to the last command in the alias.  (i.e., using the 'k'='kill'
       example, 'k bear' will come out as 'kill bear'.

Flurry is a combat skill that allows you to flail about madly in a
wild flurry.  Because of the extreme energies required to go berserk
like this, you will end up losing many stamina points.  So...  if you are
planning to run after the battle, this is not a good option.  Anyone can
flurry with or without a weapon.

0 GROUNDFIGHT GROUNDFIGHTING 'GROUND FIGHTING'~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
The mud will not let you groundfight before level 11 or 12, due to the
huge loss of hit points.  It is also recommended that you configure the
groundfighting option OFF.  (Type FIGHT to see your combat options)

Ocassionally in battle, the fighters will miss a bash and trip, or one
will tackle another.  The fight will be then taken to the ground.
Ground-fighting is no-nonsense and fast; close in biting and headbutting
can kill in extremely short amounts of time.  Once you are on the ground,
you perform on instinct.  Hard helmets make head-butts harder, masks can
protect against elbows to the face, and many other factors can
increase/decrease damage taken.

    If you are fighting multiple opponents, it will become difficult for
them to find a line of attack (since you are twisted up on the ground with
your opponent...)  However, if another attacker does find a line of
attack, he/she/it can slash/pierce/whatever you.  Since you are entangled
with your opponent, you will not be able to dodge or parry the incoming
attacks.  Also, a person assisting a groundfighting player/mob without a
weapon will not punch anymore; he/she/it will now stomp.  Stomps also
usually do more damage.  In general, it is not recommended that you go to
the ground with multiple oponents.

your hand to charge at a greatly increased rate.  You will, however, not
receive the massive bonuses to move and hit points that you might receive
if you slept or rested.  Typing meditate while already meditating will stop
you meditating and bring you to your feet.

This command is essential in large groups with anything slower than a 56k
link.  Nospam mode only shows the hits that take place during combat,
and later, will cut down the general spam associated with groups.
To bring back SPAM mode, type spam.  There are THREE levels of spam.
FULL, MODERATE and NOSPAM.  Use spam command to toggle between them.

0 AUCTION BID~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
Syntax: Bid or Bid <amount of coins>
Syntax: Auction <item> <minimum coin bid> <y/n> or Auction halt

If I wanted to sell my steel dagger, I would type: Auction dagger 400 n
This would set the auction for my dagger at 400 copper coins (4 gold)
without autotransfer (type auction alone for more info on autoxfer.)
If nobody buys the item in an allotted time, it will close the
auction, freeing the channel for other auctioners.

If "Going twice" has not yet been heard, you can remove the item from the
auction block by typing Auction halt.  Abusing this to frustrate players
will start mean mobs hunting you, and/or you will become and outlaw.

Bid, with nothing after is shows you the item currently for sale and the
current bid, or the minimum if no-one has bid.
Bid <amount> sets your bid on the item currently for auction.  Note: you
may not bid more than the total coins you have in the bank and on your
person.  Note: if you spam the mud with bids of 1 increment, it is likely
that certain mobs will start hunting you, and you may become an outlaw!

0 SOLD~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
Once an item is sold by auction, you must contact the other player and
arrange a time/place to meet and exchange the object and money.  The best
place to do this is in the auction house or bank if the buying party
needs to withdraw cash.  You may want to arrange friends to be present
just in case the other party decides to take off with your cash or the
object!  Note: YES, this is legal, don't come crying to gods about it.
There is a chance if you rip someone off that mobs will start hunting you
and/or you will become an outlaw.  You have been warned :)

0 POLICY POLICIES~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
Ignore the following.  There is no policy on whining since I will never
be online to see people whine.

This policy is simple for some, but may also get some deleted.

If you rag on the mud or a god in any way, shape or form, your character will
be frozen for two days minimum.  This includes calling gods cheaters (which
we aren't), complaining that something is totally unfair (see bottom note),
or calling the mud lame.  To get him/her unfrozen, you must write a
serious letter of appology to kilith@gryphonmud.com (I don't mean letters
like, "I think I was justified because" -- this'll just get you frozen
longer). If you can convince me that you will no longer insult the mud or
the god you insulted in the letter, you will be unfrozen after two days.
If not, tough luck... go play another mud or start a newbie.

Anyone starting a newbie after having their character frozen to whine or
TALK (ie argue) will get both their normal character deleted, and that
site newbie-banned.  If you feel you have something to discuss, write.

As always, it's my discretion whether or not you're ragging on the mud or
not, and all I have to say is, if you rag on the mud or any god just a bit,
you better hope I'm in a damn good mood, or you can take a two day siesta
from the mud.

If you are upset and feel you can't stop from complaining, calling the
situation unfair, calling a god a cheater, etc..., I strongly recommend
logging off before you open your mouth and get your character frozen.

Please NOTE: If you feel a situation really needs looking at (ie, a player is
abusing something, multiplaying, or there is a bug and you are stuck some-
where, etc), then feel free to send a pray.  As long as your attitude isn't
one of some uncontrolled teenager's frantic whining, I'll probably investigate
and do whatever it takes to get the situation fixed.

General rule: Think before you open your mouth, and take a break or complain
to other players if you are pissed.  If you ask us, "Why'd you do that?"
I'll probably answer.  If you respond "but blah blah.. whine whine, complain"
I'll probably justify my standpoint slightly.  If you continue to disagree
and spam my screen (I am often doing room descripts), you'll be frozen.
Simple.  Most of you will never have any problems with this :)

0 RULES RULE~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
On Void of Reality, we try to keep rules to a minimum.  Most of the rules
are hard-coded in, and cannot be broken due to software prevention.
However, you should be aware of certain rules to avoid character deletion:

0. READ AND UNDERSTAND HELP POLICY.

1. RULE:  Multiplaying is LIMITED!!

NOTE: An easy way to get your characters deleted and site-banned is to
      log in a good character, then log in an evil character for a second
      to check who is currently playing on the evil side or spy.  This is
      a serious offense, and will result in deletion the very first time
      you are caught breaking this multi-play rule.

      Also another way of being deleted is by using a second character
      as a storage character. I do check logs and if I find your second
      character logging on and off while your first character is online
      your second character will be deleted with out notice or warning.
      If I also find short logins on your characters I will check into it
      and if one is loaded with EQ it will be deleted.

FAQ: What happens if someone is playing from my same site, but we are
     not multiplaying and I get accused?
ANS: You will be investigated.  Both characters' email addresses will be
     mailed, and you will notice it writes to the logs when you connect
     from the same site of someone who is already playing.  Most of all,
     don't worry; if you provided and accurate email address everything will
     be cleared and you may continue playing as usual.
FAQ: How do you check for storage characters?
ANS: Every two days we run a program that notifies us of low level characters
     that have quite a few items.  We investigate from there by email address
     to determine if it is indeed a storage character.


2. RULE: No scripting.  Using a client or script language to play your
   character for you is illegal.  If your character is found to be repeating
   a loop of easy kills, you will be investigated.
   CONSEQUENCE: Instant deletion of your character.
   EXCEPTIONS: Casting spells to get better is fine I have no problem  
   but if you are caught BOTING for xp you WILL be DELETED!!
FAQ: What if I like hanging out in a low-level area?
ANS: 'Tis fine, just don't let us catch you repeating a command-loop.

FAQ: Is it ok to stay in newbies after level 40?
ANS: No and if you are caught all levels over 40 will be lost.
{R}*So that noone thinks you can stay in newbies if you are not scripting*{N}

3. RULE: No spamming.
   CONSEQUENCE:  If you are caught spamming players or channels, (this
   INCLUDES the auction and pray channels!) you will be deleted and your
   site will either be newbie-banned or permanently banned.  If you aren't a
   total dick, you can probably apologize in email and I can lift the ban in
   a few days.

4. RULE: All bugs must be reported.
   CONSEQUENCE:  If I watch you exploit a bug that is used to crash the
   mud or cheat, and you do not report it, you risk being deleted and
   sitebanned.  This is the rule I am most strict about, sorry folx :P


That's all for the rules.. remember, might makes right, and get some
friends so that berserk backstabbing dork doesn't getcha while you sleep!
We don't encourage player killing between good/good evil/evil, but it CAN
happen occasionally!  Kills sometimes get stolen too... tough shit!

0 CHALLENGE~
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
If, for some reason, you wish to fight a player but not to the death, you
can now do it in the arena.  Both players must be at full hit points, and
the format is challenge <player>.  The challenged player must then type
accept or decline, or he may turn challenge off.  After the waiting room
and battle, you will be transported with full hit points back to where
you were.  To cancel a challenge, type challenge <player> cancel.

You may turn Challenges OFF... See help CONFIG.
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
~

0 IGNORE~
Format: Ignore <annoying person name here>

Ignore with no argument will show you who you are currently ignoring.
You may ignore up to 10 people, and when ignored, no says, gossips,
tells, replies, or anything will be seen from them.  This can be a life
saver with poor-sport newbies who get on to annoy you because you killed
their character :)  ALWAYS report spamming characters through a note,
telling at what time they spammed you, and exactly what happened.  Often
spammers will be immediately sitebanned.

~

0 RP-RULES ROLEPLAY~
Role playing Rules and Regulations:

1. It's just a game.  Roleplay how you wish; but do not ruin it for others.
2. Global channels are global channels.  If you don't want to listen,
   turn them off... There is no restrictions to what can be said on them.

That's all folx!  Happy mudding... and remember.. it's just a game :P
~

0 DISCLAIMER~
We are not a politically correct mud; however we do not encourage foul
behavior or language.  People may swear over the global channels, and if
this offends you, please leave as soon as possible.  We understand that
we cannot please everyone, and if you are offended by swearing or rude
behaviour (What do you expect from college student and high school student
players?) then it is recommended that you MUD elsewhere.  The system
administrator and creators of the MUD take no responsibility for any of
the actions of the individual players.  Please read help linkless.

Disapproving gods may take action by sending a mob to hunt you down or
giving you some time in the mud-jail.  (You've been warned) ;>  Switching
between whitie/darkie is reason for deletion too.

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated, you don't die permanately.
Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed, together with
all of your equipment and gold.  Corpses are SAVED OVER REBOOTS and do
not appear until you enter the world again.  Abuse of this feature will
result in character deletion or removal of items.

1) Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
2) You lose experience points for dying.  When you die, the experience points
   you lose are based on your total exp points.  You can never lose a
   level from death.  You also lose all yer equipment which is usually
   the toughest aspect of dying.  Experience loss is much lower for
   player kills than for mobdeath.
3) You can die if you don't eat or drink.
4) You will be transported to a certain hall of ressurection depending on
   your alignment and/or race.

Corpses decay after time, but in players' corpses, objects do not decay
with the corpse.  LOOTING OF CORPSES IS FINE!  Just make sure the guy
doesn't have 10 friends ready to beat you up if you loot his corpse!
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (30 minutes of real time)
unless they are looted, in which case they only last 1 game hour.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP LEVELS~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a varying
amount of experience points for each level of experience.  To find out how
much you need for the next level, use the 'score' command.

You gain experience every time you hit a mob or player and do damage,
when you cast an offensive spell that damages a player or mob, and when
you kill a monster or are part of a group that kills a monster.

You lose experience by dying, and a small bit from fleeing.

Experience awarded by mobs varies depending on how many have been killed,
their level, their extra bonuses, etc.  Help GBONUS for group experience
division.  Sometimes barons or gods will sponsor or help you out when you
gain levels, but this is not a common occurance.

Type 'level' for a list of experience needed for each level.

Syntax: enter <object>

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.

CLIMB is used to climb objects that are climbable.  If the object can be
climbed either up or down, you must give a direction.  Otherwise, no
direction is necessary.

RUN will move you in a direction until you can't move in that direction

casted on you or you are a Dragonkin race which inherits 'fly' at start.
~

0 LIGHT EXTINGUISH~
Syntax: light      <light object>
Syntax: extinguish <light object>

Lighting a lightable object can only be done with a tinderbox tool.
Extinguishing a lightable objects puts out the light on demand.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; SAY LISTEN REPLY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: listen <character | all>
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

LISTEN allows only the character you select to be heard in the same room.
This is useful for holding conversations with one person in a crowded
room with lots of people SAYing, without having to use TELL.
LISTEN all will turn off LISTENing.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.

NOTE WRITE will start the online text editor so you can enter a note easier
than using note +.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.  Use NOTE + to write message lines onto the note, one line
at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST or NOTE SEND posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

Syntax: yell     <message>
Syntax: chat     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for GOSSIP.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

This document contains the rules by which you can use, alter or publish
parts of DikuMud. DikuMud has been created by the above five listed persons
in their spare time, at DIKU (Computer Science Instutute at Copenhagen
University). You are legally bound to follow the rules described in this
document.
                                           
Rules:
                                    
   !! DikuMud is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!
                                        
   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of DikuMud in
   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for
   distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge
   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.
   By breaking these rules you violate the agreement between us and the
   University, and hence will be sued.      

   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or   
   sources given to you.
   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give
   away any part of DikuMud (which is to be done as described in this
   document).
                                    
   If you publish *any* part of dikumud, we as creators must appear in the
   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this
   license. Before publishing you must first send us a message, by
   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us what, where and when you are 
   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)
   
   If you wish to setup a version of DikuMud on any computer system, you
   must send us a message , by snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us where
   and when you are running the game. (remember to include
   your address, name etc.)
   

   Any running version of DikuMud must include our names in the login
   sequence. Furthermore the "credits" command shall always cointain 
   our name, addresses, and a notice which states we have created DikuMud.
                                    
   You are allowed to alter DikuMud, source and documentation as long as  
   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.
   
   
Regards,
The DikuMud Group
   
   
Note:
   
We hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports
on bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that we are all using our spare
time to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their
time. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project.
If you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to
hear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive
new updates and improvements made to the game.

0 TAP BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: tap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

0 GCONSIDER~
Syntax: gconsider <victim>

This command shows you how well your group would do against a mob if
you were taking the hits.  It is best if the would-be "tank" or "buffer"
uses this command, as it will be the most accurate.  Only group members
actually in the room with the mob will be used in the gconsider command.

See also: CONSIDER
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <victim>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.

See also: GCONSIDER
~

0 GBONUS~
First of all, I would like to state that the reason for grouping is NOT
to gain mucho exp fast (although it CAN be done in a very good,
fast-moving group).  The main purpose of grouping is hunting, safety, and
equipment hunting.  Enough of the blabber.. here are the equations:

experience each member gets = (MOB_EXP * (1+(members/10))) / members

There are slight bonuses for killing higher level mobs with smaller groups.
With this equation, you can see a group of 15 gets 2.5 times the mob
experience, only it is divided by 15.  A group of two gets 1.2 times the
mob experience, divided by two, plus a small "small-group" bonus
depending on the level mob they kill.

~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character> or ALL

TYPE HELP GBONUS to find out about GROUP BONUSES, exp division, etc...

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight if you have autoassist on.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you type HIDE <object> you will hide an object in the room.
Other people in the room will see you hiding it, so be warned.

If you type HIDE along (nothing after it):
If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.

SEE ALSO: SEARCH
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT

 Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  When you re-enter the game you will be back in the
same room you quit in.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
However, you may find that you cannot quit immediately after combat; this is
so that you may not quit to avoid being chased after.
~

0 SPLIT~

0 MANA~
Although each character has a certain amount of natural mana, spells
above level 10, and greater mana amounts can be achieved through the use
of GEMS.  Gems add mana, increase mana regneration rates, and allow you
to cast more powerful spells.  Natural mana regenerates VERY slowly.

Common gems that are sold in magic stores often cannot cast
higher level spells and hold less mana than less common, more powerful
gems.  Also, you cannot cast a spell like fireball with an earthen gem...
there are four types of gems and magic types: Earth, Air, Water, and
Fire.  Experiment around to see what spells use which or read the help on
each spell individually.  There are rumors of gems that can cast all
of the types of spells, but few mortals possess gems of this power.

To cast spells, first you have to learn them.  Then practice makes perfect
when attempting to successfully cast.  Finally, the use of gems for the
empowering of spells is a must.

Syntax: hold <gem>

Gems are the source of mana or magical energy needed to cast spells.  There
are (4) types of gems based on their elemental use.  Once you hold a gem
it begins to charge up for use.  There is a down side to this, as you will
be only left with 1 hand to fight with.

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
The elements are as follows:

EARTH
Nature, the earth, controls mending and binding magicks.  The earth shields
and heals.  It is the element of earth that holds the most powerful healing
spells, and it is also this element which can be used to thwart dangerous
foes.

AIR
Air controls travel and visibility, twisting and bending lights and shadow.
Air conceals, and it also can forcefully move like the winds of powerful
storms.

FIRE
Fire allows the unseen to glow brightly, to light the darkest room and to
burn harshly the most evil.  Fire allows a person to see the truth behind
the dark shrouds that covertly conceal many.

WATER
Water, the cleansing spirit, dominates and overcomes with unfolding strength.
It is a holy thing, coveted and used to help cure the sickest and vilest of
diseases, whether those diseases be plagues of the heart or of the mind.

DEATH
Death allows Necromancers to raise corpses, cast hexes, and attack spells.
This type of mana is only used by Necromancers and is worthless to any 
other class.

102 ASAVE~
Type 'asave' for more info and its usage.
Used to save area list, area changes, zone, and entire world.

102 SCRIPT~
Scripts are divided into LABELS of code (code chunks) and TRIGGERS.
Triggers call a code chunk, and are activated at a set time (which you set).

To edit a code chunk, use EDIT CREATE <name>, or EDIT <name>.
Code chunk names can only be up to 10 letters long.

To type in your code, precede all lines with a :1, :2, :3, etc... as line
numbers.  You may insert something before line two just by typing :2 stuff to
insert.  To clear a line, type .c <ln>.  If you forgot some line numbers,
type .f to format it and make it look pretty.

to list all triggers, type listtrig
to list all code chunks, type listcode

Inside the code:
Code is basically interpretted by what is calling it "as is".  There are
some special functions though:

@P              Substitute the person who triggered the script's name here
@M              Substitute the mob who is running the script's name here
@O              Substitute the object who is running the script's short desc
@V              Substitues the vnum (object if obj, room if room, mob if mob)
@R(min,max)     Random number between min and max.

@Cx             character stat reference... here are the currently supported
                ones:  (NOTE they ARE case sensitive)

                        e = 1 if evil, 0 if good
                        g = 1 if good, 0 if evil
                        l = character's level

                eg: if @Cl>=10 then (read as: if level >= 10 then)

GOTO <ln>       jumps to a line number in that code chunk
CALL <label>    jumps to another code chunk/label
RECHO           echos something to the room.
WAIT <x> <type> where <x> is the number of ticks.  <type> is one of these:
                superquick : fastest pulse, about 3 per second
                quick      : a tick is about 1 second with quick
                heart      : a tick is the length of a heartbeat (regen)
                hour       : the wait is a full game hour
DONE            ends the script here and then, wherever it is encountered
CREATE_MOB <v>  where <v> is the vnum of the mob to create.
CREATE_OBJ <v>  where <v> is the vnum of the obj to create.
DESTROY_OBJ <v> where <v> is the vnum of the obj to destroy.
DESTROY_OBJ     with no arguments, if it's an object script, destroys the
                object upon which the script is running and ends script.

IF              This is a powerful command, but you must know how to work it.
                You may compare two numbers using ==, >=, <=, >, <, or !=

                You may compare two strings using == and !=

                You can do things such as: IF @R(1,3)==2 then

IF (flag)       This checks if the given flag is set on the character
IF (!flag)      This chekcs if the given flag is NOT set on the character

IF is followed by a " then", and nothing else on the line.
If the statement is TRUE, then the NEXT LINE, and the NEXT LINE ONLY! get
executed.  This is in the style of assembly language.  You CANNOT use {} like
in C.  This makes GOTO and CALL very important.

examples:

:1 if @R(1,3)!=2 then
:2 call not_two
:3 say the number was equal to 2!

..or..

:1 if (!OR2) then
:2 goto 5
:3 say You have the orin 2 flag on, btw.
:4 done
:5 say You don't have the or2 flag on!! setting it to on!
:6 pset @P scriptflag OR2 on

..or..

:1 if @P==Orin then
:2 echo Orin is in the house everybody!!
:3 done

---------------
Useful flags!!!
---------------
Note: Objects and rooms may only set things, etc.. they cannot "say" "tell",
etc... they can, however RECHO.

Flags are up to four letters long and are stored on the character.  To set
a flag, your script (or you can do it manually) should use:

pset playername scriptflag <sf> ON/OFF

Here are some examples:
pset @P scriptflag SF1 ON
pset @P scriptflag AAA OFF

Please note... 'clean up' script flags in scripts.. if you have temporary
script flags, make sure to have the flags cleared when the script is
complete, and make it so only a single "script complete" scriptflag is on.
There can be up to 3000 script flags stored on a character.  However, it
doesn't keep track... if you remove a script from the game, characters will
retain the 3 or 4 letter script flag identifiers on them.

Script flags can't overlap.. make sure to come up with some scheme.. for
insance god PALIO might use PA1 - PA99, and ORIN might use OR1 - OR99.

---------
Debugging
---------
Only ONE person may be in debugging mode at once.  To enter it, type DEBUG.
All error messages generated by scripts will be routed to you.

Important: You MUST asave triggers and asave code when you want to save your
work!!!!!!

SCRIPTEDIT
----------
Format: scriptedit create <trigger_id> or scriptedit <trigger_id>

Each trigger has a unique ID which can be up to 20 letters in length.

GIVEN           When given object       OM
DROPPED         When dropped            OR

Keywords hold extra data.. for instance, the keywords:
'hello there' 'hello' 'greeting' 'hi'
would be used in conjunction with a SAY trigger to go off when a player
uses one of those expressions in his/her SAY command.  A blank keyword with
a say/tell field will trigger always when a player says/tells.

with given/dropped, keywords can hold a list of vnums to trigger on.
If blank, any vnum will do.  EG: if it's a mob script, keywords holds a list
of vnums the script will trigger on if the mob is given object vnum X.
If it's a object script, keywords holds a list of vnums of mobs the script
will trigger on if the obj is given to this mob.

Coming in the future: (possibly) GIVEN_MONEY, ON_DEATH, OBJ_SACCED

                        the room and such can trigger it.

                extent.  Without helmet it does 1-50 damage OUCH!
                Also, the victim's helmet will be damaged if it is metal
                (ie has a higher armor class).  Note: high dexterity and
                intelligence and wisdom may allow you to dodge the rocks.
 arrowtrap      This makes arrows shoot "out of nowhere" to hit the victim.
                Arrows are dodgeable and victim's armor makes a difference.
                Dodge depents on intelligence and dexterity. 1-30 dam
 poisontrap     Exactly like above but if hit, you will be poisoned for
                1-10 hours.  If poisoned, it will add 1 hour for each time
                you get hit.
 gastrapone     This can be used for swamps and sewers.  Does 1-4 damage
                ocassionally and cannot be dodged or saved against.
 gastraptwo     A much meaner version of gastrapone.  It does 1-35 damage
                and poisons the victim.  If victim is poisoned, it adds
                1 hour to duration.
 spiketrap      Players sometimes fall on spikes and get damaged (spikes
                should be in the room description to use this trap!
 avalanche      NOTE: An avalance only goes off once!  It does enormous
                damage, and therefore it is recommended that an avalanche
                room be set to no_mobs, so wandering mobs don't trigger it.
 manadrain      This room drains mana when you stand in it (the gem
                the victim is holding).
 gysertrap      This will make it so a spray of scalding hot water hits
                its victim, doing a good amount of damage.  Make sure
                you put in your room description about something that
                could do such a thing, like a gyser.  Otherwise this trap
                won't make much sense.

                               {R}ROOM EDITOR
{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
{N}Redit is a powerful editor which allows for creation of rooms, creating exits,
linking together rooms, setting traps, ect. To enter the room editor, use REDIT. 
No vnum is specified after redit; You must be in the room you wish to edit. To create
a blank room to edit, you can use redit create <vnum>. However, in most cases the 
DIG command is easier (explained below). First of all, use flaglist to see available 
flags in any editor, including redit!

 

{R}REDIT COMMANDS
 

{G}Done                                  Quits the editor.

{B}<ENTER>                               Shows info on the current room.

{G}Name                                  Sets the rooms name.

{B}Desc                                  Enters the rooms description (make sure you are in redit 
                                      other wise you will end up putting the description on 
                                      your characters description)

{G}}                                     go to the next vnum {R}(GOD ONLY)

{B}SH                                    Marks the room as SHADED

{G}LI                                    Light cancels Shade (this is the default of rooms)

{B}Copyto <vnum>                         Copies the room description in the current room TO the 
                                       specified room vnum.

{G}Copyfrom <vnum>                       Copies the room description in the current room FROM the 
                                       specified room vnum.

{B}Nameto <vnum>                         Copies the current room name and sector type TO the 
                                       specified room vnum.

{G}Namefrom <vnum>                       Copies the current room name and sector type FROM the
                                       specified room vnum.

{B}ED ADD <keyword>                      This adds certain descriptive things to a room. For 
				       instance: ed add statue large granite will allow me to
				       edit the description if a person looks at statue large 
                                       granite.

{G}ED EDIT <keyword>                     This allows you to edit a descriptive thing already in the
			               room. To edit the large statue, I would type: ed edit 
                                       statue. (not statue large granite).

{B}ED DELETE <keyword>                   This allows you to delete the descriptive thing already
                                       existing in the room. To delete the large statue, I 
                                       would type: ed delete statue.

{G}ED FORMAT <keyword>                   Formats the description like .f in editor.

 

{R}This next section is on SECTORS and how each sector affects movement.

 

{g}To calculate movement loss, use the following equation.
(move cost of sector you are leaving) + (move cost of sector that you are entering) / 2
Or if you are flying:
(move cost of sector you are leaving) + (move cost of sector that you are entering) / 3

Then....
Add 1 if you are carrying > (strength*2)
Add 1 more if you are carrying > (strength*3)
Add 2 more if you are carrying > (strength*4)
Add 3 more if you are carrying > (strength*5)
Add 4 more if you are carrying > (strength*6)

Add 1 if the player has no shoes on.

Divide this number by 2 if easier_moves is on in power.dat.

To set a rooms SECTOR, simply type the sector name in the desired room (while in redit).
Here is what each sector does.

 
{B}Inside           1 move        This room to be covered. Marked as always lit. (ie. Shop, ect)

                               trails evaporate twice as fast in the desert.
{G}Snow             8/21 moves    Very tough going.

{R}Ok now for the Best commands in Redit: the Direction Commands.

{B}<dir> delete                       Deletes the exit and link in the direction. Warning this 
                                   ONLY deletes ONE side making a one-way exit from the 
                                   other room!!!
{G}<dir> destroy                      Deletes BOTH the current exit and the opposite exit in the 
                                   room it is linked too.
{B}<dir> link <vnum>                  Links the current room to a pre-existing room <vnum> in the 
                                   direction specified (ie. West link 19485)
{G}<dir> dig <vnum>                   Creates a room and also links the room in the direction 
                                   you have specified. (ie. You are in room 100. You type 
                                   west dig 101. You have now created room 101 and made an 
                                   exit from 100 west into 101 and also from room 101 an 
                                   exit east back into room 100.)
{B}<dir> room <vnum>                 Creates a one-way link FROM the current room to the 
                                   room <vnum>
{G}<dir> desc                         Sets the description for the current exit. If the exit has 
                                   no link, this message will be displayed when someone bumps 
                                   into or looks at this direction. If this exit has a door 
                                   this is the description of the door.
{B}<dir> door                         Creates a door in this direction.

                                   underwater.
{G}<dir> name <exit name>           This sets the doors name. For instance: west name door or

                                 For instance, a character with 24 strength could break up 
                                 to a (24*2)=48 strength door.
{G}<dir> key <obj vnum>             Sets the key to this door as object vnum <vnum>.

{R}Room FLAGS
 
{g}To toggle room flags on/off, simply type in the name of the flag while in redit.

 
{B}DARK                          This room in always dark (character needs a torch/infravision 
                              ect.. in he/she wants to see)
{G}NO_MOBS                       No mobs can enter this room. However, mobs can be created here; 
                              they just wont wander here.
{B}INDOORS                       Used often with inside sector. Marks the room to have 'a roof' 
                              or 'ceiling' aka.. indoors.
{G}PET_SHOP  {R}dont use{G}            This toggles this room as a pet shop room. If this room is vnum 
                              1501, vnum 1502 MUST be an isolated room where the mobs this room
                              will sell repop in.
{B}NOHEAR                        No yells can go through this room. I have seen with my mud that
                              this flag is used as the no recall flag. It might be a bug within
                              my code but I have no idea.
{G}NO_SUMMON                     You cannot be summoned from this room.
{B}UNTRACKABLE                   This room does not leave tracks of anyone who has passed through, 
                              nor can anyone scry anyone in this room.
{G}MOVING                        NEVER SET MANUALLY. See section on ROOM TRANSPORTS/CURRENTS.
{B}NOMAGIC                       No magic will function in this room.

{B}EXTRAHEAL                     Characters heal faster while in this room.
{G}FALLFAST                      Use ONLY with AIR sector. Specifies non-flying characters can 
                              walk into this room, at which time they begin to fall down 
                              to the room(s) below.
{B}EXTRAMANA                     Characters regen mana faster while in this room. Often used 
                              with the EXTRAHEAL flag for mana rooms.
{G}FIRETRAP                      Fire comes up from the ground and burns members in the room. 
                              Dex+Int is used in avoidance. Damage ranges from 1 to 30 hp.
{B}ROCKTRAP                      Rocks fall from the ceiling. Based on Dex and Int. Damage ranges 
                              from 1 to 50 hp.
{G}ARROWTRAP                     Arrows shoot out and hit characters in the room. Dex, wis,
                              and Int allow avoidance. Damages from 1 to 25, but good 
                              magic armor or natural armor helps in absorbing this damage.
{B}POISONTRAP                    Same as arrow trap except the arrows are poison-tipped.
{G}SPIKETRAP                     people fall onto spikes. 1 to 35 damage, but depends on 
                              natural/magic armor.
{B}GASTRAP2                      1 to 35 damage; gas chokes the character, and may poison. 
                              No saving from stats. Dont use gastrap1 it doesnt work!!
{G}AVALANCHE                     This room trap only goes off once! (total!!!, not even each 
                              reboot!). it does 10-55 damage regardless, and 20-40 more
                              33% of the time (trapped under the snow).
{B}GYSERTRAP                     Scalding water hits the character. 10-40 damage.
{G}MANADRAIN                     Slow or negative mana regen in this room. Reported to be 
                              problematic, although not proven. (infinite mana?) 
                              On my mud it does give infinite mana nice work 
                              Owen Emlen(tm) code :)
{B}IS_VEHICLE {R}Dont use{B}                   See section on the next page on vehicle rooms.
{G}CLANSTORE                     Marks this room as a clan storage location. This MUST 
                              be within 20 vnums of the clans starting vnum, as 
                              specified in CEDIT (clan editor) See later section
                              on Cedit.

{N}Wild elves, in general, are those elves who have recluded from society and
are living hardened lives outside of the elven community.  Wild elves can
be considered a different race due to their small difference in anatomy.
Wild elves' skin is covered in a set of stripes that are a variety in color,
texture and size.  In addition to the multicolored stripes, wild elves
have a keen sense of their surroundings.  Like elves, Wild elves also can see
in the dark using their natural ability for infravision.

{N}The exact origins of the thri-kreen have been lost in the mists of time,
however myth says they once lived in great hives in the tropical forests.
However their kind has not been seen upon the surface of the world in any great
numbers in centuries. Rumor has it that they Thri-Kreen moved beneath the
surface to escape the approach of mankind, however there may be other reasons.

Half man and half insect, the thri-kreen do not readily adapt to the society of
human folk. As a natural self defense mechanism, the Thri-kreen coat their
weapons with a poisonous venom which their bodies produce. Thri-kreen appear
to have a natural tolerance to poison and disease, a attribute of their
insectoid ancestry.

inferior cousin of the Thri-Kreen.  Although many centuries have passed
they still share the exoskeleton of their distant cousins, the Thri-Kreens,
allowing them to absorb massive amounts of damage. Shri-Kreens have only
recently been seen above ground, and the few encounters have usually been
brief and violent. Shri-Kreens have adapted to be able to see very well in

Syntax: Replace learns - to receive 10 practice sessions.

Syntax: Replace practices - to receive 1 learn session.
 
The replace command is to fluidly switch around practices and learns in order
to make it easier for the player to learn skills/spells without having to wait
for a level.
 
NOTE: This command can only be used when the user reached level 10.

{N}He is the owner and head admin of the mud.
Will be married to Sabelis on June 24th, 2006 :)

{N}Kilith has been part of MpV's life since 1996 as a player, but since 1999 
has been the owner of MpV. Without Kilith, I'm sure most would agree that this 
mud would cease to exist.  He has done a great deal with this mud and continues 
to improve it every single day.

He is a wonderful builder, helpful teacher, amazing admin, and an awesome 
boyfriend. I believe I and everyone else can learn a great deal from this man.  
I'm sure it will be a pleasure working with such a kind, nice gentlemen that I 
love so dearly.

{N}She is an Admin and Co-Owner of MpV3/VoR.
Will be married to Kilith on June 24th, 2006 :)

{N}Sabelis is a new member to the Midpoint Void/Void of Reality crew. 
She has been a mudder for about 5 years. She was a player of the mud in 
2002 and has recently become an co-owner/Admin of the mud due to her 
willing to learn mud code and also build on the mud.

As of March 12 of 2005 Sabelis and I have become a couple and are very
happy together. I do not know what I would do with out her. My love for 
her grew very fast and I have never had anyone understand me more then this
woman could in the time we have known one another. I am very glad that she 
said yes to becoming my girlfriend and I am glad for the time we have shared
within the time of knowing one another.

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
There are a few commands you can do at the bank to store items.

At any time you can type store to get a list of what items you own that
are stored in your bank storage. You can ONLY take them out of the bank
when you are at a bank teller.

syntax: store <item>
Will tell you how much it will cost to take that item out of the bank
later.

syntax: store <item> yes
Will store the item in the bank (if it is storable.)

To remove an item from the bank:

First of all you must have enough money either in your bank account or 
on your person to remove the item.

syntax: unstore <item> or <number>
Will list how much the item will cost to unstore.

syntax: unstore <item> or <number> YES
This will unstore the item as long as you have enough coins to do so.

{d}[{R}+{d}]{B}-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-{d}[{R}+{d}]{N}
Syntax: Flash

Flash lets you get in an "instant circle". In order to use it, you must
be wielding a dagger in one hand, and holding flash powder in the other.
Then type "flash" once you are already engaged and you will attempt
to get in an instant circle (Even if your opponent is attacking you!).
Flash powder is rare, so save this for important fights.
