Name Beginning of a Clearing~
Descr
The area here seems to clear up and to the north a large clearing can be
seen.  The screeching here is loud, but not as intense as it was before.  To
the south the forest seems to go on forever.  Far to the east you see the
walls of Masque.  For the first time since leaving Masque you feel peaceful.

The forest is quite open here.  It would almost pass for plains if it

You have entered what looks to be a large dark forest.  The strange thing
about it is that there are not many trees.  You can easily move about this
area.  As you look around you notice many stumps of cut down trees and that
that there is almost no growth on the forest floor.  The forest here is
quite dark and as you look up you notice that no light even penetrates the
foliage.  This forest seems to continue to the north and east.  You can see
a trail to your west.
