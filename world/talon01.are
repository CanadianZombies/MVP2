Name A Steep-Rocky Trail~
Descr
You are walking along a rocky trail. Its rocky and there are rocks and a
few rocks. You notice a big rock and some little rocks. There is also a big
rock that catches your attention. The rocks that lie around this rocky trail
make the rocks extremly unstable. If you are not careful about the rocky
rocks then you might slip on a big rock or mabye a little rock. There is
also a chance you might slip on a medium rocky rock. You doubt you will slip
on a pebble because they are just really small rocks. OUCH!  You just
stubbed your toe on a big rocky rock!  I told you to watch out for them big
rocks!  The rocky rocks are still extremley unstable and you pick up a rock
and throw a rock and it losens a few rocks proving your point of the rocks
being unstable.

Name The Psychadelic Mushroom~
Descr
You are standing inside the tavern known as "The Psychadelic Mushroom". A
few tables and chair sit on the floor where adventurers can rest thier bodys
while ordering some famous spore pot pie. Your stomach begins to rumble as
the smell from the kitchen reachs your nose. The one thing you notice above
all about this tavern is the bright array of colors which swirl around the
walls and tables.
