run by your feet at a tremendous speed. You wonder what could possibly have
frightened that creature so badly. You hear some deep breathing and feel
like you are being watched.

You are in a gloomy marsh. You hear screams in the distance, and you
think you see some lights in the distance. This is definitely not a place
you want to get lost in. You suddenly see a giant six foot long salamander

frightened that creature so badly. You hear some deep breathing and feel
like you are being watched.
