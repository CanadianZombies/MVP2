just north of your current position.  It would probably make a nice
sanctuary from the outside world - a place were you can find a nice bar and
catch a nap.  South of here the gravel path continues towards many large
mountains situated in the south-east.

Many large bugs fly around in circles as you make your way along this
small gravel path.  In the far north you can see a small evil-looking
outpost of some sort.

The gravel path in which you trudge along makes a sharp turn to the east
in this area - it seems to be leading towards a set of large mountains.  In
the very far northern distance you can see a large evil outpost.

Your feet make a loud crunching noise as they walk over the small gravel
rocks that have been scattered all about this small path leading south and
west.

As you walk southern on this gravel path, the mountains that you could
see earlier have become of an enormous size.  As you begin to wonder what
possibly may lie within their frigid grasp, you decide that a quick beline
towards the outpost north of here might be a better decision.

Directly east of you lies a large mountain constructed of pure granite
stone and rocks.  Not too far to the south, the gravel path in which you
travel upon curves east into what seems to be the main vestibule to these
enormous mountains.

The gravel path you trudge along quickly makes a sharp turn eastern,
leading onto a less-travelled path.  You become dizzy as you look straight
up and attempt to glimpse at the very top of these large mountains.

Your feet become dusty as you walk along this un-packed path leading
towards the main entrance of some enormous mountains that lie just east of
here.  To your west the path transforms into a hard-packed, travel surface
that begins to lead northward to safer grounds.

East of here lies the large mouth of a yawning cave, leading into the dark,
frigid mountains.  Your instinct tells you that it would probably be a good
idea to make your way back to town at this point, and discontinue travelling
eastward.

You stand within a cold, dirty prison cell that has been probably never
been cleaned in decades.  Rats crawl along the floor, looking for a shread
of meat to munch on, for they look very hungry indeed.  To your east lies
the prison door that leads back out to a titanium hallway.
