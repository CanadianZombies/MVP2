Name At a Ruined Stone Tower~
Descr
You stand at a ruined tower, located in a grass clearing.  You can't hear
any birds or other small animals, and it just adds to the feeling of dread
you have been sensing for a while now.  The tower has crumbled, and the only
way you can see to enter would be to move some of the loose stones on the
ground.  A staircase leads up, but ends abruptly at a place where the tower
was seemingly ripped off from its foundation by some evil energy.
