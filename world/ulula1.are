Human prisoners wander about here in eternal torture.  A simple wide
cavern with no doors or windows.  The heat is almost unbearable
and the floor is covered in blood.  Minion fly around doing Hades
dirty work and keeping the prisoners in line.

Name Hades HQ~
Descr
Around you flames rise up melting your flesh.  The walls are charred
 pure black and there is no sign that anything living has ever
 set foot upon this ground.  Hades stands here towering over you
laughing at the thought of you trying to kill him.
