There is a mist in the air. It surrounds every tree, bush, and stone.

you can really put your eyes on it. The air feels strange, it smells of
violence and maybe even death. Cold wind is blowing but the mist is not
moving.

Clouds overhead look ready to burst down the biggest thunderstorm ever
created. Air becomes feel with moisture and vapors start rising from the
swamps. It is rumored that those vapors are the reason why so many brave man
and women did not come back. But nobody knows for sure because not even one
returned and told the tale of the Adfeida swamp.

Cold rain starts coming down from the sky and lightining can be see
striking the group far from here. The vapors are suddenly gone and the air
feels refreshed. However it starts getting cold and shivers start running
down your spine. Suddenly a crack of thunder goes off right above and rain
pours on even harder.

The rain keeps on going and its starts getting darker. The wind picks up
once more, but this time there is a feel death in the air for sure. Perhaps,
there could be another reason why so many people have vanished in these
swamps. Then, a gust of wind brings a sounds of howling and something else
to your ears...
