Name On Top of the Tallest Tree in the Northern Forest~
Descr
The view is incredible from here.  To the west, you can see open fields,
large forests, and huge cliffs.  To the south you can see the great city of
Xylar.  To the north you can see large mountains and the long northern road.
The view to the east is blocked by the huge tree trunk.  There is a small
treehouse above you in the highest branches.  To the west is a large
drop-off..  You better be flying if you choose that direction.

Name A Frozen Path~
Descr
The ground is frosted over here, and you can see pure ice on the path to
the north.  To the south you can see the path bend, and up to the north you
can see a large mountain.

Name The Great Northern Road~
Descr
The northern road bends to the east and south here, and you can see a
tall mountain to the northwest.  The air grows chilly and a cold wind lashes
at your exposed skin.

Name The Great Northern Road~
Descr
The northern road bends to the north and west here, and the dirt
underfoot it hard and packed.  A light frost covers the ground, and the air
is chilly.  A cool breeze blows against your hardened face.

Name The Great Northern Road~
Descr
The great northern road runs to the north and south here.  A ways to the
south you can see the road bend, and far to the west you can see a large,
strange-looking mountain.  You can just barely make out the northern forest
to the south.

Name The Great Northern Road~
Descr
The Northern stops here and the only obvious way back was the way you
came, south. The chill air and frost covered ground makes you shiver as you
travel. Few birds chirp this far north in the world. A tall oak tree sits on
the side of the road blocked with a huge stone. You continue on your way
without paying it any regard.

Name An Underground Training Center~
Descr
You stand in an underground training center which is suprisingly advanced
for being underneath such a primitive village.  Perhaps this is why the
creator built it here; who would expect such a magnificent facility under a
village of brainless apes?
