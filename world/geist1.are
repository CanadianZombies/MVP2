Name A Small Cave Entrance~
Descr
You come across a small man made passageway. The area around you is tight
and a stale earthy smell fills your nose. The walls are of pure dirt and
fragile as if it is going to crumble. You hear scurrying sounds around your
feet as you stumble on the loose dirt ground. The area ahead of you is
silent and dark.
