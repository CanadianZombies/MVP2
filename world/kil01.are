where you can kill mobs for easy xp. Please remember when you are thinking
about attacking a mob use the "CONSIDER" aka con <mobs name> command. This
command will help you when finding out if this mob will be easy for you to
kill of difficult for you to kill. You are allowed to be in the newbie zone
until level 15. If any gods find you xping in the newbie zone after you have
reached level 15 you will be transfered to Limbo and your extra levels and
skills will be removed!!  This is your only warning of this offence. HELP

The town square has much to offer. A nice fountain covers the whole

fountain seems to help restore magical powers and also heal a small bit.
This might be a good place to meditate.

Name A Small Magical Forest~
Descr
It seems some of the magic powers that destroyed the old world made a
magical forest with in the bottom of this cave. Even though this forest
seems to be below the earth somehow the sun shines through the tops of the
trees, or at least it seems to be the sun. Many different animals wander in
the forest looking for food.
