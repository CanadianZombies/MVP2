Welcome to the mages sect. Here are the things you will need in order to

join our sect: You must first have obtained a token from an area seller. If

you have not yet obtained level 30, you may give that token to the statue

for membership into our sect. 

 

Once you are a member, you may say "enter sect" for safe passage into our halls.
