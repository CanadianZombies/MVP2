Goin further along the path, you are suddenly startled by a horrible
scream from the forest from the north.  At first you believe it is a cry of
pain from some huge animal, but you then realize with a grin that it is a
call of triumph.  Your humor turns to dread as you decide that the creature
capable of making that sound would be able to crush you without a second
thought.  The gates of Masque loom off to the east and the path seems to be
destroyed to the west.

The stones that make up this part of the path look to have crumbled to

enough to crumble, and that someone must have smashed them.  Then once again
you have a feeling of dread as you realize the size of creature it would
take to smash these massive stones.  The feeling of evil that existed
earlier is at its peak at this point on the path, and suddenly you hear that
horrible cry again.  Off to the west you see that the path is repaired, and
it continues off to the east.

here are shined and polished and almost seem to glow in the light.  The
feeling of evil that dominated the atmosphere to the east is gone, as if the

The trail here has been replaced by black stone slabs and they seem to
absorb all the light that touches them.  You almost feel drawn to their
opaque surface but turn away as you again think of the great Castle of
Krynn.
