Name Temple hallway~
Descr
The long temple hallway comes to a northern terminus at this point,
though there are doors to the east and west, and well as a stairwell leading
further into the depths.  On the north wall you see another of the
tapestries so prevalent in this area, this time it features an albino white
Kerin, being ripped to pieces....  By other Kerin!

Name Large pool~
Descr
The large pool taking up the bulk of this room immediately draws your
attention, and then you notice small benches placed at its perimeter.  The
air is hot and humid, no doubt the pool is spring fed, from deep in the
earth.  Perhaps this is some sort of purification center.

The piles of discarding personal articles, and broken Kerin necklaces and

blood confirm your suspicions.  This was a place prisoners were, or still
are sometimes, held.
