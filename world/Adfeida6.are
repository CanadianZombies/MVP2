Name Amidst the Adfeida Swamp~
Descr
The scent of decay can clearly be sensed here. Large fungi are attached
to logs and fallen trees on the ground. You also notice some strange
bacteria floating on the surface of the water.

Name Amidst the Adfeida Swamp~
Descr
The muddy water below you is now up to your knees, and the ground you are
standing on seems to be sinking. You feel strange creatures brush against
your leg as they swim by. Completely disgusted by this, you search for solid
ground.

Name Amidst the Adfeida Swamp~
Descr
This part of the swamp is very gloomy. You can barely tell if it is day
or night, for a dreary darkness covers the area. The sound of buzzing
mosquitos can be heard in the vicinity, along with chirping crickets.
