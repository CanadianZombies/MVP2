Name The Rolling Hills~
Descr
The plains around you slowly change into a vast layer of rolling hills that
seem to extend beyond sight.  The smell of fire drifts in from the north,
though there seems to be nothing to indicate that the trees nor shrubs that
dominate the region are on fire.  The chatter of small animals brings warmth
as you scan the region for danger.

Name The Murky Swamp~
Descr
The hills ease into a large swamp that seems to have sprouted from nowhere,
though you figure this is the gathering pool for a small river that twists
through the land.  The bog is quite murky and deep, making travel almost 
impossible and discouraging further exploration of the area.  To the south
a huge stone juts up from the ground, it surface slick with moss and other
vegetation.

valley beyond sight.  Clinging to the vally floor are hundreds of tents,
their strange and dark fabric making them almost impossible to see.  Strange
voices seem to ring out from around you.  You are shocked to find yourself
in the middle of a large encampment.  Shapes twist around you, circling.

Name In the Melee~
Descr
A thick plume of dust and smoke fills the air, making visability somewhat
hard. The magical darkness that lingered in the south still remains here, 
though it seems somewhat weakened.  In all directions you can see large
groups of darkelves and giants fighting each other.  You wonder how long
this stalemate can continue.

Name Nearing the Keep of A'bon 'Dhor~
Descr
The field qiuckly slopes upwards and forms a quaint little hill that is
easy to climb.  Were it not for the terrible fighting and carnage, the hill
would be quite enjoyable and relaxing.  At the top of the hill is a large
keep, its stone walls towering far above you.  The keep is seems to be 
inhabited by a large contingency of giants, some of whom notice you approach.

Name At the Gates of the Keep~
Descr
The greet doors of A'bon 'Dhor rise up to greet you with smug acceptence as
you approach it.  The doors have been fortified in order to prevent the 
surrounding darkelves from gaining entrance and seem quite impenetrable.
Several giants pace high above you, wondering what you are doing here.  The
rising rocky walls to the west and east make it impossible to gain access to
the keep by going around.

A large checkpoint opens up here, signifying the true entrance to the keep.
While this area might once have been rarely used to guard against people
entering the keep with ill-intent, present circumstances deem that several
giants make sure nothing evil breaks through the gates and reaches the actual
keep. Two doors lead off to the west and east, most likely into guard rooms.
A large intersection lies to the north.

which extend well above thirty feet, guide you down the carpeted floor of
the hall.  Several large pictures, most depecting several historically 
important giants, hang from the wall, their value priceless.  While the
lighting here is enough to see, it is quite dark, adding to the ominous
environment.

leaving only the south open.  The mountains are beautiful and capped with
snow. To the south, you notice a large valley and, though it seems to be
mysteriously dark, you can make out movement and small flashes; the battle
must still be raging fiercly.  The platform is littered with thin arrows and
you wonder if you are an easy target for the drow archers.

Name A Training Room~
Descr
The floor of this large room is covered with thick straw, most likely to
buffer the fall of the various giants that train in here.  While this room
was raraly used during times of peace, it is quite filled with giants and,
to your surprise, various other warriors from different races.  Several racks
of armor and weapons line the wall and the smell of sweat is very strong.

The hall continues to run north and south here, twisting through the

you pass them by.  A small door lies to the east where the sounds of combat
can be heard quite clearly.

Name The Intersection of Halls~
Descr
The Western and Northern halls intersect here, making the intersection a
crowded area.  Several giants are transporting various metals, weapons, and
other goods to the east while others are grimly speaking of the war.  The keep
gets brighter to the east, where a large hall runs into the heart of the
famous keep.

Name Hall of Ah'rv~
Descr
This is the main hall that runs through the center of the keep.  Named 
after one of the founding giants of the keep, it is lavishly decorated.
Several large pictures line the wall and vases are sprinkled around, giving
the hall a regal feel to it.  A thick red carpet runs with the hall, which
intersects with the the Western and Northern halls to the west.

Name The Northern Hall~
Descr
The Northern Hall seems rather bland compared to the others in the keep.
The walls, while smooth, seem to have been hastily carved from the mountain
and lack any sort of meaningful decoration. Several torches flicker as you
delve deeper into the keep and you notices another door up head.  The door
looks quite solid and is guarded quite well.

Name The Rough Cell~
Descr
It is quite obvious that this cell was hastily created sometime recently.
The walls are still jutted and rough, as is the floor to your discomfort.
Despite the speedy construction, the room is huge and adequate for a cell.
On the western wall, several rows of drow hang in shackles, their eyes
directed at you with curious wonder.  Your attention, though, is drawn to the
north, where a single drow is shackled.

The Norther Hall turns south here, eventually connecting with the main

travelled compared to the others.  The thick smell of earth and rock lingers
in the air and the sounds of chatter can be heard coming from a distance in 
the south.

This hall is quite brief, serving only as a connector of the Heart and the

kings of the hall line the walls here.  To the north, a large circular room
with a table can be seen.  Various soldiers filter in and out from it.

The throne room extends well beyond sight and, to no surprise, is layered
with gold and gems, all embedded in huge columns that reach to the ceiling.
A thick white carpet leads north to a large dais where the throne itself can
be seen.  The throne is fit for a large giant and riddled with rubies and
opals. The hall is quite busy and filled with various giants, all speaking
to the king about the events shaping the war.  Various diplomants filter in
and out, grim looks on their face.  The hall is well guarded and any hostile
actions would be met with severe punishment.

This rooms is shaped more like a large octagon, rather than a circle.  Its
walls are lined with portraits of various famous giant commanders who led
their nation to victory time and time again.  In the center of the room rests
a huge table, surrounded by large chairs filled with giants.  They all seem
quite busy and dont notice you.  A large map is pinned to the northern wall
and the heads of several drow have been hung as trophies on the eastern wall.
The giants are plotting against the drow that have surrounded the keep.

This small rooms holds a significant portion of the king's treasure.  
Unfortunately, most of the treasure appears to be sentimental or, at least, 
not have significant value outside the walls of the keep.  Shards of crystal
and a few chests sit in the middle of the room, covered in gold and other
metals of value.  Various swords and other weapons hang neatly from the walls,
their surfaces shiny and new.  The only exit is back the way you came.

blackened stone swallowing you up.  The slick walls house several glowing 
mosses which barely provide you with enough light to determine that this
is the entrance to some large catacomb.  A huge boulder seems to block the
only way down.

cannot identify.  Perhaps this was not the best idea after all.
