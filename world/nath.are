Name Repair tent~
Descr
In this tent many young skaven scurry from one end of the tent, to the
other carrying broken weapons and armor to the blacksmith.  The blacksmith
looks to be of the tinkergnome race, the skaven must have spared his life
for this sole purpose.  He is chained to the wall by his ankles and is not
permitted to move out of a certain area.

Name Tyud's Armor~
Descr
As most Skaven prefer, this shop does not seem like an armor shop at all,
but that of a cloth and leather store.  Skaven hate to be weighted down by
heavy armors and prefer to wear light plate or a thick leather instead. 
This could easily be compared to most of them having a scrawny appearance.

Name Entrance to the Drunken Rat~
Descr
This is the entrance to a cheerfull place with music playing loudly and
the sound of chattering skaven echoes throughout the room.  The not rare
sight of a passed out skaven soldier or citizen at your feet makes you
realize how much these creatures love their alchohol.  Bar fights break out
in 10 minute intervals and sometimes result in the death of a fellow skaven
or two.
