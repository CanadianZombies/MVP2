Name A Tunnel Beneath the Fort~
Descr
A rough-hewn tunnel stretches into the darkness before you. You
periodically trip over rocks or other unseen obstacles. The air is thick and
oppressive to match the walls around you.

Name A Cramped Passageway~
Descr
A tight passageway leads down under the outpost. You find that there's
barely room for your shoulders to fit through. The walls feel damn and the
humidity is stifling.

Name A Small Cramped Cell~
Descr
The cell is dark, moist and altogether unpleasant. The stench assails
your nostrils and makes you want to turn your head and rid yourself of any
meal you may have had that day. There are rusty shackles attached to the
walls around you. You thank whatever power that renders the fort silent for
sparing you the pained howling of the prisoners here.
