Name In the River Tarr~
Descr
The river Tarr flows out of the Vorulivian mountains in the east and
flows through the city of Aethenon. It curves southwards into the swamplands
and then basically disappears into a lake in the swamp. The water flowing in
the river is a deep blue-ish color to a greenish color, depending on where
you look. The water seems exceptionally clean, despite the fact that it runs
through a large city. The river current is fast and the water is deep, but
one could probably swim across it.

As you enter the room you are overdone by the sudden urgency of
relaxation. The floorboards are suprisingly durable and strong that have
defied weather's wrath for ages. When overlooking the present vicinity, you
make out nonunderstandable symbols marking the temple, while the sweet smell
of incense burns with its location hidden. Somewhere from down under, a
faint chant echos from somewhere.

From atop the tower, one can see many, many miles on a clear day.
Mountains, forests, fields and even other cities can be seen far off in the
distance. It's easy to see that these towers in Aethenon were well built for
their purpose. The amount of area that can be seen from here helps Aethenon
to be one of the best defended cities around.

creating a decorative resistance to infiltration. To your south and west
comes the ceaseless water of the river Tarr.

Name Forest Road~
Descr
A rough, stone road twists through the dense forest, providing at least a
decent path for traversing. Sometimes the road goes up over large roots. The
trees provide much shade for anyone that happens to be travelling along the
road most of the time. In some places, though, plants over-run the road a
bit.

Name On the River Tarr~
Descr
The river Tarr flows out of the Vorulivian mountains in the east and
flows through the city of Aethenon. It curves southwards into the swamplands
and then basically disappears into a lake in the swamp. The water flowing in
the river is a deep blue-ish color to a greenish color, depending on where
you look. The water seems exceptionally clean, despite the fact that it runs
through a large city. The river current is fast and the water is deep, but
one could probably swim across it.

bit.

Name On the River Tarr~
Descr
The river Tarr flows out of the Vorulivian mountains in the east and
flows through the city of Aethenon. It curves southwards into the swamplands
and then basically disappears into a lake in the swamp. The water flowing in
the river is a deep blue-ish color to a greenish color, depending on where
you look. The water seems exceptionally clean, despite the fact that it runs
through a large city. The river current is fast and the water is deep, but
one could probably swim across it.

Name Forest Road~
Descr
A rough, stone road twists through the dense forest, providing at least a
decent path for traversing. Sometimes the road goes up over large roots. The
trees provide much shade for anyone that happens to be travelling along the
road most of the time. In some places, though, plants over-run the road a
bit.

Relocating the city, you can make out the Vorulivian Mountain range
scattered around the city making almost a barrier for invading by masses.
The wind from the mountains send small gusts of wind cooling the daylight's

Name Jade Park~
Descr
Jade Park is mostly nature's home, hardly any of man's crafts have
formed this wonder. Maple trees swaying to-and-fro in the wind causing the
scent of maple to carry all over Aethenon. You notice the flowers staying in
a constant cadence creating a serene feeling. Whether night or day, the life
in this park refuses to disperse with its harmony.

Relocating the city, you can make out the Vorulivian Mountain range
scattered around the city making almost a barrier for invading by masses.
The wind from the mountains send small gusts of wind cooling the daylight's

Name In the River Tarr~
Descr
The river Tarr flows out of the Vorulivian mountains in the east and
flows through the city of Aethenon. It curves southwards into the swamplands
and then basically disappears into a lake in the swamp. The water flowing in
the river is a deep blue-ish color to a greenish color, depending on where
you look. The water seems exceptionally clean, despite the fact that it runs
through a large city. The river current is fast and the water is deep, but
one could probably swim across it.

Relocating the city, you can make out the Vorulivian Mountain range

Name The Center of Darkness~
Descr
Just when you thought it was impossible to get darker, it seems to have
done so. This is the epitome of darkness. One can wonder what horrible
things are down here. There was probably a reason that the lower levels of
the cathedral have been sealed off.

Name Inside the Northern Guard Tower~
Descr
The steps wind seemingly endlessly around the walls of the tower. In war
times, the towers of the city are depended on to warn the city of
approaching invading armies. The wooden boards the steps are made of seem as
if they are sturdy enough to support anyone, but one can't be sure. Small
windows allow one to look outside as they make their way up or down the
tower.

Name Atop the Northern Tower~
Descr
From atop the tower, one can see many, many miles on a clear day.
Mountains, forests, fields and even other cities can be seen far off in the
distance. It's easy to see that these towers in Aethenon were well built for
their purpose. The amount of area that can be seen from here helps Aethenon
to be one of the best defended cities around.

quite a barren place except for the large rocks ranging from a variety of

the sparse vegetation that there is.

Name A Field West of Aethenon~
Descr
You are travelling pretty close to Aethenon's Aqueduct. You smell the
strong aroma the grass gives when at this high level of healthiness. You can
roughly hear the rushing of water as it travels with undenied passage right
above your head. The plant life here is moist but not quite as moist to the
grass living closer to the aqueduct.

Name On the River Tarr~
Descr
The river Tarr flows out of the Vorulivian mountains in the east and
flows through the city of Aethenon. It curves southwards into the swamplands
and then basically disappears into a lake in the swamp. The water flowing in
the river is a deep blue-ish color to a greenish color, depending on where
you look. The water seems exceptionally clean, despite the fact that it runs
through a large city. The river current is fast and the water is deep, but
one could probably swim across it.

The frail blades of grass look ideal for a children's play area. As you
move further out into the fields, the blades of grass slow your pace. You
can faintly hear Aethenon's Aqueduct in motion off western from here. The
northern gate tower rises high above the wall as a lookout for defense.
