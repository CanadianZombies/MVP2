ExtraDescr thick metal greaves~
These massive metal plates, bound together by tough leather straps, are

Name The Ultimate Torture Room;Hell~
Descr
You stand in a large room, nearly 50 feet in length and width, with a
very high ceiling.  Various instruments of torture and pain-giving devices
line the walls, and several tables have been set out here, some with very
rusty, dull blades lying on them.  A large list is on the wall with the
cryptic letters, "Banned sites" scrawled on it.  There is also a big bucket
full of body parts labelled, "Cheaters".  You better hope you are in here
just for a simple reimburse or discussion, or you may be in for an
unpleasant suprise.

Name Character Creation~
Descr
Sounds of friends who are calling you to come out and play tag with them
come from the north.  Voices from the west call out to you, urging you to
come pick some pockets just for fun.  To the east, all is quiet, and the
smell of parched paper and the murmur of turning pages beckons you.
Note: You should probably "wear all" at this time if you have not already.

Note: You may select a profession AFTER you have finished with this character
      creation sequence.  Use "profession list" and "profession add <prof>".
      The "attrib" command will show you which professions you probably
      should *not* be.

PS: Even if you don't like reading, you should make an effort to read the
    room descriptions carefully here in character creation :)
