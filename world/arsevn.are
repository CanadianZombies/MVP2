                          WAR CONTINUES


     In our eternal struggle against the infernal Merkitz, we have made little


progress, even now the war is at its usual standstill.  Casualties this


month have been minimal, we have only lost 14 warriors.  Unfortunately they


seem to breed faster than we can kill them.  Rumor has it that there is a


Queen Merkitz deep within the pit, we hope to one day find and destroy her


but our luck so far has been bad.


 


 


                        PARTY PROBLEMS


  The President has asked that all gnomes PLEASE do not smoke gnelk petals


before a battle, it has been statistically shown that it slows down combat


reflexes and could possibly cause your death.


 


                        TOWN TIDBITS


Whit's has shown a dramatic increase in his sales this month, we attribute


this to hard times on the front, and many grieving widows.


 


The President was found dallying around with a pretty young gnome..


WOO HOO, he still has a little life in him after all.


 


      this issue has been brought to you courtesy of Whargo.


 


P.S. don't feed the guardian.

Descr
As you suspected the road leads into a large cave in the side of the
mountain, it looks to be well used, and you don't feel that there is any
danger to be found.  In fact there are many fairly fresh wagon tracks
leading into the cave.  To your west the road continues back towards the
northern road and Gnarnoc.

The scened before you defies description, thousands upon thousand of

corpses, some half eaten scattered around the room.

You have entered a HUGE cavern.  Broken and unbroken merkitz eggs fill
the room as far as you can see.  A monstrous thick web hangs from floor to

allow passage in that direction.  The ominous sound of something huge moving
about can be heard from the web.  You fear for your life and soul.
