Descr
Days last long in the swamps and nights are short, but even during the
short period of darkness, the conditions are unbearable. Temperatures drop
below freezing and the wind is so cold that every part of exposed body
immediatly gets a frost bite. One can't help it but wish for the nights to
grow shorter.

During the day, the sun can not be seen very often and everything looks
pale. The mist howering above the swamp is probably the cause of this color.
This is no ordinary mist, it stands still ten feet above ground, not moving

Vegetation in a swamp is not as scarce as expected, although its unusual.
Trees and bushes are rather common on a small island above the sticky mud.
However, they take on various shapes and have very different sizes. Some are
twisted in virtually impossible angles and some stand high and tall like

Name Adfeida Swamp~
Descr
Around you lies Adfeida swamp. Maybe brave adventurers tried to cross it
and found their ends in its muddy bottoms. There are scarse trees all around
and you see bushes here and there. Suddenly sounds of walking in the mud are
heard and you turn around to get a better look, and see nothing....

Name Adfeida Swamp~
Descr
There is a mist in the air. It surrounds every tree, bush, and stone.
Sometimes you think you see something move in the mist, but is gone before
you can really put your eyes on it. The air feels strange, it smells of
violence and maybe even death. Cold wind is blowing but the mist is not
moving.

Name The Beginning of a Swamp~
Descr
Water seems to be ankle deep in all directions from here. Ahead lie
several dry islands, or at least they look like they are dry, in this cold
smokey air, the mist could be playing tricks even on the sharpest eyes.

Clouds overhead look ready to burst down the biggest thunderstorm ever
created. Air becomes feel with moisture and vapors start rising from the
swamps. It is rumored that those vapors are the reason why so many brave man
and women did not come back. But nobody knows for sure because not even one
returned and told the tale of the Adfeida swamp.

Cold rain starts coming down from the sky and lightining can be see
striking the group far from here. The vapors are suddenly gone and the air
feels refreshed. However it starts getting cold and shivers start running
down your spine. Suddenly a crack of thunder goes off right above and rain
pours on even harder.

The rain keeps on going and its starts getting darker. The wind picks up
once more, but this time there is a feel death in the air for sure. Perhaps,
there could be another reason why so many people have vanished in these
swamps. Then, a gust of wind brings a sounds of howling and something else
to your ears...
