Name The Entrance to the Northern Caves~
Descr
You have stumbled upon some cold, dark caves leading from the known
world. Cleverly hid for ages from the human eye, they have only been
discovered in the last year, although some storys say they were used long
ago as an alternative route to the evil's homelands. The caves look as if
perhaps ages ago they were mined out, most likely for diamond.
