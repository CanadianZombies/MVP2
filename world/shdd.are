You are on an old cobold road.  As you walk along the road you wonder
what's holding it off the ground.  To the north of you lies a very seedy bar
called the Dragon Claw Tavern.  The road continues on to the east and west.

Name Black Fang Road~
Descr
You are on an old dirt road.  It's beyond you how it got in the sky. 
This is one of the busiest roads in the town and you have to work to avoid
getting bumped into all the time.  To the north you can make out a large
fountain and the silhouette of Dark Smoke, that must be the town square.  To
your east is a sign that reads "Arena...  If you dont wanna fight, dont come
in here"

Name Bob's Tools of Protection~
Descr
This is Ophidia's armor shop.  The service isn't very good but it's worth
it.  Be warned, Bob does get a little cranky sometimes seeing as how half of
his customers fall to their death 5 miles below.  If you think he's in a bad
mood it's probably best to leave now or you could end up leaving in a
casket.  And remember Bob's motto is, "Buy our stuff cause you'll probably
need a little more between you and a whitie's blade then just skin."

This is the bank of Ophidia.  From the outside it looked run-down but on
the inside it's very classy.  The walls are painted a dark maroon and the
window curtains are a blood red velvet.  The vault is framed in gold and the
rest of it is a solid steel.  You feel very secure in storing you money and
valuables here.  In fact your only real concern is that the bankteller is a
demon and they aren't usually very trust worthy.

breathing above makes you think even if the guards are defeated, whatever's
up there should take care of the whities.

On the inside the Dragon Claw Tavern appears to be very seedy.  The

drinks dont look too healthy.  The walls are covered in pictures of heros
and dragons.  Most of the pictures are of Dark Smoke (the town guardian)
ripping elves and dragonkins to pieces, or killing them with acid breath. 
In the north-east corner of the Tavern is a bar and some stairs to the

Name Black Fang Road~
Descr
You are on an old dirt road.  It's beyond you how it got in the sky. 
This is one of the busiest roads in the town and you have to work to avoid
getting bumped into all the time.  To the north you can make out a large
fountain and the silhouette of Dark Smoke, that must be the town square.  To
your west is a large house, whoever owns it must be very wealthy.
