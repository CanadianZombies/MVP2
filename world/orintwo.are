Name A Thick, Rocky Forest~
Descr
A small stream gets a little larger here because of the drainoff from the
lands around here.  To the south, the stream is surrounded by huge,
impassible trees on both sides.  The only way of going to the south seems to
be to swim in the stream.

The air is quite still and the trees block out much of the sun during the

it on your skin makes you feel a bit uneasy as you plow through this thick
forest.  The forest lightens to the east, and you can see a path in that

Tall trees rise up on either side of the bank, forcing you to stay
swimming in the chilly river.  The river is fed by small streams flowing
down from the sides of the bank, and the stream grows rougher and larger to
the south.  You begin to doubt that any swimming skills would help you in
the waters to the south.
