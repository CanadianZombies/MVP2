ruins.

Name A Mirrored Corridor~
Descr
This area of the ruins seems more upkept than the rest.  For some reason
there is almost no dust here.  The walls are lined with mirrors that almost
seem enterable.  Obviously there is something strange about this corridor.
The corridor continues to the north and south, but from the east comes a
strange, bright glow.

On the edge of this towering cliff, the wind blows so powerfully that you

strange rock which rises out of the ground in the center of the square.
The origin of the rock is unknown, but it's bright aura and the fact that
it's been left alone obviously means something.  Perhaps one day more might
be known about this strange rock.

Name Southern Hallway~
Descr
The southern hallway wraps around the northern side of the palace.  The hall
is lit with torches since all the windows have been closed.  The decor here
is stunning, and it is obvious it is the home of royalty.

Name The Prince's Chamber~
Descr
The high-elven prince's room is a bit smaller than the queen's room.  The
prince seems less affected by the death of his father than his mother does.
It is rumored that his father's ghost visited him and brought him a gift.
What sort of gift might he have for his son?

Name The Queen's Chamber~
Descr
This is the high-elven queen's chamber.  She doesn't seem to leave here that
much since the death of her husband a few years ago.  She doesn't seem to
have recovered from the shock of his death yet.  The chamber's lighting is
not as bright as most of the other rooms in the palace.
