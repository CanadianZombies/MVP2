Name Main Path to Zakaraz Volcano~
Descr
All arround you the vegetation seems to be on fire, the plants glow red
and seem to have lost all life. No animals seem to survive this terrible
heat and humidity, even you seem to have trouble breathing. The only
remaining life here seems to be about a dozen vultures flying arround
looking for corpses or even the slightest sight of food. The sun's light
never seems to come much across these lands, although the time might suggest
day, night entangles this area in eternal darkness.

Name An Intersection of Paths~
Descr
A small path wich seems to be leading to the east forms here. A small
coyote goes from bush to bush trying to hide from the vultures. You wonder
if going to the east would not make your journey easier, this intense heat
is now beginning to dehydrate you.

Name A Small Side Path~
Descr
This path seems less traveled than the main path, but much more bearable.
As you scan the room left and right, you notice that the green in plants and
bushes is now apparent. You notice that the evil presence is only less
effective arround here, making the sunlight glow on the soil.

Name A Sharp Turn~
Descr
This path is now taking a sharp turn to the south, leaving you thinking
if it leads anywhere. Still, as you go farther and farther away from the
main path,the sky becomes lighter and lighter while the evil presence is
slowly fainting.

Name A Small Path~
Descr
Here the path is coming back to it's normal direction. You notice other
small animals move front and back through the bushes, eating plants and
trying to stay away from the volvano. Although this path appears to go away
from the volcano, it is much more comfortable to travel onto.

Name A Small Path~
Descr
You continue walking forward and see how the vegetation grows more and
more. In contrast to the main path, where evil controls all, the farther you
go east the weaker the evil presence gets, there seems to be a good force
counteracting the darkness.

Name Continuing of the Path~
Descr
The closer you get to the volcano, the harder it gets to breath. The life
has now been totally drained from the environement. The ground is now
becoming half soil half cold lava, making walking a trial and error method.
As you look in the distance, you can see lava flows burning forests and
lands to chaos.

Name Bordering a Lava Flow~
Descr
The path is now covered with lava and you practically have to jump from
rock to rock to do forward. The intense heat from the lava makes you sweat
intensly. As your water drops into the burning lava more steam forms arround
you, making breathing a harsh task. The only source of light is the red lava
flowing next to you.

Descr
To the east, the main path has been covered with mana, and as you look
north you suddenly loose your balance when you see the immense cliff wich
has probably been formed by an erruption. To the south, more lava flows by
you, awaiting for you to fall into it. The path seems to somewhat continue
to the west, although the walking ground is getting slim.

Name On the Edge of a Precipice~

The path now starts to slowly go down towards the cliff, making heat and
humidity a factor wich should be well considered. As you look far in the
distance, you can see a dark stop on the west side of the volcano, all the
evil energy seems to be coming in waves from there, you can only wonder what
it is.

To the south is what seems like a small resting point. As you look in the

as you approach it. The radiant energy coming from it is now getting strong,
you can wonder how such a small point can create such a change.

The grass seems to be a little smaller here. Warriors, mages, and
travelers seem to gather here before they continue onward. Most of the
travelers talk of a hard road ahead. Some of the warriors seem to be
bragging about who might get to bring home the biggest trophy from the
legendary castle which lies somewhere in the vicinity.

Name Moving up the Volano~

The top of the huge volano is now in sight. Steam and smoke clouds lift
into the air as high as the eye can see. A weird chant can be heard very
dimly from here, it seems to be coming from inside the volcano itself! 
Could this be the hidden castle that the warriors talked so much about
raiding?  Only time can tell.
