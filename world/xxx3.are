Name evil orc~
Short an evil-looking orc~
Long 
An evil-looking Orc is wandering around the forest here.
~
Descr
The Orc before looks lost.  He also looks fairly week.  You think to start 
to wonder what he is doing here, and how he will ever get home.  Perhaps
you should do him a favor and kill him.

Short a Wild-Elf banker~
Long 
Vesa, the village treasurer stands here counting coins.
~
Descr
Vesa is a rather ordinary Wild-Elf.  At first you are inclined to judge
him as being a weakling (for a Wild-Elf that is).  But upon furthur
inspection you would say that he is not a weakling, but one who has had much
more than fitness to worry about.  His appearance is a bit rough, but you
think that his responsibilities as the town treasurer may be the cause
behind that.

Amazing! That is all you can say when you see this creature.  Of course you
have seen elves before, and you have even seen some of the more "tame"
Wild-Elves, but this is a true Wild-Elf!  He blends in with the surrounding
brush so well you are just glad you caught a glimpse of him.  Besides his
skill for stealth you sense that he is a very worth opponent in battle as well

whom many credit the victory over the Orcs.  Of course that was sometime ago
and it seems that the two races may be headed for another war, but the fact
remains that one of the best warriors in history is here looking at you! 
Jorn is of average size, but it is said that his skills in both fighting and
tactics are some of the best ever seen.  You have also heard that he is a
decent spell caster as well.

Wild-Elves from the village.  His light features and slight build suggest to
you that he is not cut out for much and may follow the path of many of his
friends and move to one of the larger cities.

the sort of loyalty that works in the Orcs favor, however this sort of
mindless attitude also could be blamed for the fall of Orcs in the war. 
It's a good thing for the Orcs that they have at least a few members with
leadership skill.

A Dark Knight Minion Of Leshrac is here, not happy to see you.
~
Descr
The look on this mighty creature's face does not look like one of
enjoyment.  It seems you have disturbed him.  Huge fangs gawk from his wide
mouth, and saliva drips from the corners of his lips.  He kinda has the
hungry look in his eyes, and you have the feeling that you might be his idea
of a quick lunch.

out here that would have needed such a trail.  Even more difficult to
believe is that there is really nothing left to be found.

Name Bend in the Overgrown Trail~

The trail bends south and east here.  Although when you think about it,
you find it hard to even call it a trail.  It is so overgrown, that it is
more of a suggested path.  This is the edge of the forest with a large
clearing to the north.

You have come to a small clearing.  It is good to once again see the sky

all around the clearing.  This looks like a great place to relax and maybe even
take a nap, but then again maybe you had best find you way back to town.

almost want to walk to where ever it is that you are going.  You are

What a crazy lake.  Perhaps that's what Lakkaudri means, crazy!  You are
begining to feel hopelessly lost.  What brought you out here?  Some legend? 
Well at least the area is just as beautiful as before.  The lake bottom
appears to be around thirty feet deep, but there are jagged rocks and thick
plants, it looks best to stay above the surface.

Name The Hidden Village of Tausakko~
Descr
The shadows from the trees all around are very heavy on this side of the
thicket.  To the south you can harldy see a thing due to the darkness and
several large shrubs.  Far to the north you can see a Wild-Elf standing
there, but there is a lot of open ground between you and him.

Name A Small Home in the Brush~
Descr
You have found the home of Margaret and Gunthar Von Klopfenbauch, and the
childhood home of their son, Farben Von Klopfenbauch.  This is a rather
interesting place with the hidden entrance and the rather spacious interior.
These Wild-Elves live a very simple life, and that is no doubt the reason so
many go out and seek adventure.

This area is rather dark.  The large trees around it block out almost all

the more immediate area is of greater interest to you, however.  The bushes
in this room are like none you have ever seen.  They are very well tended

Descr
Again the strange black grass-like substance covers the ground here. 
Looking around you once again you notice nothing out of the ordinary, other
than the horrid demons scattered about the area.  But for some odd reason
they are not hostile towards you, it is if they have something else on their
mind, or someone else.  You can make out a wall nearby to your east, and
another one fairly far off to the north.

Here along the eastern wall of the keep you still notice nothing
spectacular.  The sky is dark, the ground is steaming with mist, and still
loud screams fill the air.  You have yet to see anything fearsome enough to
cause such screams of pain, which leads you to believe this place isn't as

racial oddity.

other signs of magic use.  Other exits are to the north and east.

For some unknown reason this room is lit.  Come to think of it how it is
lit is another unknown.  There appears to be no light source and there are
no holes in the cave celing.  Well you know that this area of the cave is
where magic is practiced, perhaps that is answer enough.

Here we find the explination for the scortch marks and other odd
occurances.  There is a shadowy presence here and you feel a strange power
coming from it.  This is no Orc, the magic is too strong, however it is no
saint either.  This being is clearly evil.

The light from the entrance is all but gone, but there is an odd light
coming from the south.  The cave here have a somewhat magical quality about
it as if hundreds of spells were cast here over the years.  There is also a
strong magical presence coming from the west.

The light from outside (what little there was) can still be seen on the
cave walls and floor here.  To the south, however it is completly dark.  Of
course Orcs can see in the dark, but there is just something a bit more
creepy about a pitch black cave.

Name Cave Entrance~
Descr
This cave entrance is much like anyother.  The shouts from inside are a
bit louder though.  The Orcs must have been here since before the war
gearing up to take on the Wild-Elves.  It is interesting to see that they
are still at it after the sound defeat that was delivered to them.  It might
be interestig to go in and take a look, but then these guards might not
agree.

This is more if the training grounds.  There are obvious signs of
struggle here as well as a few discarded limbs and bloody weapons.  This
brings up an interesting point.  You've seen a fair number of severd limbs
on the floor here, but there are no one-armed Orcs running around.  Well
perhaps they just eat them.

This looks to be the command ceter of Orc operations.  Well it was the

like a place for the Orcs to gather and pretend to be important.  Perhaps
someday a new leader will be sent here and this room will once again fill
it's intended purpose.

At first glance this room looks to be nothing more than another room in
this damn cave.  Other than the fountain in the corner it is just that.  You
are a bit surprised by the fountain however.  Orcs have to drink too, this
one just seems a bit large for their needs.  They must be thirsty Orcs.

This looks to be where and Orc cleric works.  Well i should say it is
where an Orc cleric used to work.  You can see his corpse in the corner, and
unlike the other corpses around here this one is not disolving.  Note
however that it is decomposing as the smell in this room is completely
terrible!

This is what looks like a trophy room.  There are a few pictures on the
wall and areas where others once were, probably torn down by a jealous rival
after the fall of the Orcs.  It looks like there is a fountain to the north
and the south is your only other choice for progression as a gian stonewall
blocks you progress to the west.

other directions are blocked.

The southern area of the Orc cave was once used for gatherings and
command actions.  The Orcs of today are in a state of choas though, and this
is really only a place of gathering anymore.  There looks to be a fountain
to the north, and the exit is to the east.

The cave sure has a long entrance.  This is not a very large area, infact
the cave really doesn't widen out until a little further to the west.  You
begin to wonder what it is that the Orcs are doing in this cave, surley they
are up to no good.

The entrance to the cave is nothing interesting at all.  This is not even

big hole in a moderatly sized hill.  There are a few Orcs here, and they
look like they may try to stop you from entering.

This is the main training room.  Old damaged weapons line the cave walls
as if to add a bit of class (well at least they tried).  There are a few
shields dented and rusted on the floor here.  The Orcs sure take war
seriously, but to live like this, is quite unimagineable.

This area is rather plain, considering the hidden entrance at least.  To
the east and west you are blocked, but for different reasons on either side.
To the east the trees are just too think to continue, to the west you are
blocked by a large rockface.

There is a drastic change in the forest here.  The trees to the east are

become more and more sparse and when you look the the west you see that very
few trees exist and those that do are sickly or dead.  There is also a huge
rockface to the west.

The forest is rather thin here as a large hill shoots up to the west. 
The few trees that are here are old and withered as if they had died long
ago.  There is nothing here of interest, so a return to the east looks to be
in order.
