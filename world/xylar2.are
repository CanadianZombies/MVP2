pillaged the city, things have changed for the better.  Citizens have

This magnificent chamber is the heart of the ancient's holdfast.
Strange runes which appear to be of liquid gold and platinum are inlaid
into the marble walls and floor; they hum and glow fiercely, providing
an almost blinding light and a low, droning buzz that seeps into your
head, clouding your thoughts.  A deep, constant rumbling reverberates
throughout the room as though the earth itself is offended with your
presence here.  It is rumored that the ancients held power over the
earth and nature itself...quite possibly enough to command the stones
even after their deaths.

Name Inside the Sacred Sanctum of the Ancients~
Descr
Few mortals have ever seen the beauty of the room in which you stand. 
Large magical shapes float around you, and the stone tile floor glows with
multiple colors, making you dizzy.  You feel somehow displaced, as if you
might not be just underground anymore - almost as if you could be in another
plane of existance.

A deafening roar of power and anguish whirls through this terrifying

and the feeling of dread which has been building throughout the hall
culminates in this forbidden room. What secrets needed such careful
protections as afforded here are unkown.

Name A Densly Forested Area~
Descr
The thick forest is made of densly packed, large-trunked trees.  Most of
the trees are pines, but several broad-leaved coniferous trees still have
managed to find a small bit of light under the taller trees, and provide a
nice contrast to the manotony of pine.  There is an odd path leading north
through thick trees.
