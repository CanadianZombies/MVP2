The Kwin'tarian written language consists of many symbols. The main most


of which do not translate into the common language easily. Those that do are


listed below with their translations.




 @@#@@               --Steel or any metal of strength.


 "                   --Statue, a monument usually.


 +++                 --Common for 'the' or a prefix.


 #                   --Way


 ^                   --God, Kwin'tar


 / \                 --To show something or reveal.


 +                   --A central point, or median.


 \ /                 --Common for 'to' or a prefix.


 :                   --Will


--<->--              --Application, an action.


/_______\            --Pressure, application of which.


*(*)*                --Death





Most importantly the following symbols are used for decifering those above into common words, also runic symbol scripts and writing will be covered in the next chapters.



????????? The rest of the book is too faded to read ??????????

Name A Rubble Filled Hallway~

The condition of the hallway worsens as you progress further to the west,
small piles of rubble and debris clog your path, forcing you to stumble your
way towards the barred door at the end. A moaning can be heard from behind
the door.

The two way junction of the hallway is clean and quiet. To the west lies

small rune covered door with the symbol of a book carved into it. No doubt
some sort of temple library.

Name Before a Great Doorway~
Descr
The large doorway to the east is covered in dark runes and banded with
iron. From the other side comes a loud droning chant, seemingly voiced by
thousands of mouths. The sound is almost deafening and you have to cover
your ears to avoid the pain. A sickly greenish glow comes from the other
side of the door. A large eight legged creature has been pictured upon the
center of it.
