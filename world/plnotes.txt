Welcome to Void of Reality.
 
If you are here to play the mud type wear all and then type enter portal.
You will then be taken to the newbie starting area. Read the sign that is in
the room for more details on what to do next.
 
If you are here looking for the coding job you can write a note by using "note
write" or type "Help Note" for general usage. You can leave a note and let me know who you are
what type of skills you have, and when you would be ready to start.
 
Thank you and enjoy the mud.

Subject Coding Position~
Text

Hey Kilith,
 
I'm interested in the coding position. I'm currently the Head Builder of LuminariMUD and part time coder. I helped bring
TBAMud and d20MUD together. I've also helped develop AnsalonMUD over the years (heavily modified ROM) and have run my
own successful mud (Seven Kingdoms: World of Loren) for the past 4 years. I'm looking for something new to get my hands
dirty with and your project sounds interesting.
 
My skills include C, C++ and Java (in addition I program for a living in ruby(rails)). Feel free to contact me at
the following email address: skhyldes@gmail.com
 
Hope to talk to you soon.
 
Khyldes
