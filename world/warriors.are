Welcome to the warriors sect. Here are the things you will need in order

to join our sect:

 

You must first have obtained a token from an area seller.

If you have not yet obtained level 30, you may give that token to the statue

for membership into our sect.

 

Once you are a member, you may say "enter sect" for safe passage into our halls.
