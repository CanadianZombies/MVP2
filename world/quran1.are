Name Inside a Dark Crater~
Descr
Lava can be seen leaking out of the walls inside of the crater, but
strangely enough it does not drip down. The ground is made of ash and the
hardened lava that has formed here. You begin to realize that the heat
inside of this crater is building up, and you start to break a sweat.

Name A Shady Mountain Path~
Descr
Tall cliffs and large boulders have made the borders of a path for you to
follow. The sun's light rays are blocked by the mountain's great peaks,
leaving the trail dark and eerie. The deep cracks cut into the ground give
you a feeling of insecurity, as if the ground may give way at any moment. As
you look ahead for a sign of light, you are quickly discouraged, for the
path remains shady.

Name A Shady Mountain Path~
Descr
Tall cliffs and large boulders have made the borders of a path for you to
follow. The sun's light rays are blocked by the mountain's great peaks,
leaving the trail dark and eerie. The deep cracks cut into the ground give
you a feeling of insecurity, as if the ground may give way at any moment. As
you look ahead for a sign of light, you are quickly discouraged, for the
path remains shady.

Name A Gloomy Trail~
Descr
There is something about this trail that instills fear and anxiety unto
those who travel it. It is somewhat cold, and draped with a hazy mist. The
ground under your feet doesn't seem like rock, and is cluttered with strange
stones. The scent of decay in the air makes the environment even less
pleasant.

Name A Dismal Mountain Trail~
Descr
Nothing on this trail seems to stand out, and it looks a little too
normal. A dead silence is in the air, and the dry, stale air makes your eyes
burn. The path remains barren ahead, and it almost feels like an endless
trail through the mountain.

Name The Junction of Grandeur~
Descr
This junction has been elaborately decorated by skilled artists and
masons long ago. The walls of the mountain have been carved so that the room
is circular. They have also been intricately etched and painted, showing
images of banshees and other mysterious beings.

Name An Ominous Trail~
Descr
This winding, twisting path makes its way through the sheer mountain
cliffs ahead. The walls of the mountain are runed with strange writings and
