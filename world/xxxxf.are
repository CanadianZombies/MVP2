Name Road Off The Main Pathway~
Descr
You are standing on a road leading southward .  You notice the road tends
to get more dusty further down.  One thing that get's your attention when
looking down is the small footprints that seem to be leading that direction.
Further study indicates that these are no animal tracks but those of some
type of humanoid.  Further investigation might be in order.

Name Bend In The Road~

You arrive at a turn in this soft dirt filled road.  Trying to wipe all
the dust that has somehow become attracted to your person, you find that
this would be useless if you are going to continue traveling this route. 
The road continues to the east filled with more dirt.  Looking southeast
though you notice a small grassy hill rising above the ground.  Maybe once
there you will be able to rest and wipe off this dust that is now caked on
your body.

Name The Soft Dirt Filled Road~
Descr
It seems now arriving from the east, that the dirt is mixed with
vegetation.  Looking south a trail up pressed grass leads up a small hill. 
The small foot patterns you have seen traveling the dirt caked road continue
up the hill.  There are also some other visible tracks of a another type of
creature now.  Hmmm, again you are stumped on what this could be.  Both
tracks are definately not those of a human, and this is what brings concern.

You arrive from the north and now stand before a small hill.  The climb
is rather easy, though with the dirt filled attire you have on, it will not
be a comfortable one.  The grass is pressed up on the ground as though there
is much travel through this region.  A faint smell of a pipe drifts past
your nose, and a dim melody can be heard coming from above you.  It sounds
as if whatever is above on the hill is playing a flute.  The pressed down
grass leads east and west from here and a trail of footprints lead upward to
the top of the hill.

Name Before A Hill~

You arrive from the west.  A faint harmony can be heard to the
southeast.  The grass is pressed up against the earth, reminding you that
this is a well traveled area.  The birds from the forest behind you seem to
chirp in synchronization as if they have a tune of they're own to play for
the inhabitants of this place.  You almost feel content here, as though this
place has welcomed you.

Arriving from the east the sweet melody that you hear seems to grow 
even stronger. The sound is coming from right above you. The grass
sprouts up out of the ground here, unlike the trampled grass to the east.
The trees of the forest behind you seem to echo back the sound that is
coming from above. What creature is this atop, that can send such a 
wonderful harmony through the air? The only way to find out is to
move ahead.

Name Center of a Small Hill~

Arriving from below, you look to your north with disgust at the dusty
road which has filled you boots and armor with dust.  The sweet sounds of a
flute continue to echo in from the east.  Looking south you can see the hill
starts to descend down into a grassy basin.  The grass is so high not even a
giant could walk through it with his head above it.  You can see in the
distance what looks like a city.  It is hard to determine how large it might
be due to the grass that almost is as high as the hill itself blocking your
view.

The view of the western portion of the land here is fabulous.  You notice
some smoke rising above the tree tops to far in in the forest to the west. 
It is black smoke and easy to determine that it is not a large campfire, yet
most likely a structure has been set on fire.  Looking south down the
incline the height of the grass in the basin peak's your interest.  The grass
is so high it would be such a great place to hide in times of need.  Then
again it also could house some creatures you would rather not think about.

here on a boulder looking off into the distance.  His sweet melody is almost
makes you want to sit down and relax next to him.  You can understand why
this spot was chosen by the small humanoid.  A spectacular view of the lush
green forest can be seen from this spot.  The birds chirping, and moving
from tree to tree looking for food puts a smile on your face of content.

Name In The Tall Dark Grass~
Descr
You are wandering around in a tall grassy basin.  Moving aside the grass
with your weapon as you continue foward.  This thick mass of greenery must
have been here for ages, with the tips of each strand of grass taller than
even a giant himself.  Your vision of what is ahead is blocked by the
neverending mass of vegetation, all directions seem the same at this point.

The shadows created by the tall grass, seem to gather around you.  For a
second you swear you hear the grass being shifted aside to right next to to
you.  Looking down you realize it is just a small rabbit running through the
grass and past your feet.  The chant of crickets continue to echo loud
through the thick grass making it even more complicated to hear any sudden
movement next to you.  It is impossible to tell which direction to continue
from where you stand, except to just head back south toward's the small

You stand in the starry darkness of tall dark grass. Your senses are

able to penetrate this thick mass around you. Such a place that seemed
so innocent to look at from the hilltop now seemed have a threatening
presence about it. You cannot tell which direction leads where and to

You stand at the great gates of Paravallen.  The guards greet you with a

much of a fighting type of race, they have been forced to form an elite
guard, due to the goblin kingdom to the south.  Goblins do not like that the
kenders have come to live on what they consider they're land.  Attacks on
the city always end in failure for the goblins, but recently a large group
of goblins was spotted traveling a few miles south of the city.  The king
has ordered his finest guard to be on full alert, as he suspects that that
goblins are planning to launch a full scale attack from near by.

borrowing, with intent to return the item one day.  Maybe they tend to leave
they're houses unlocked so each of them can go borrow from each other.  What

You are in the office of the current mayor of Paravallen.  Hundreds of
paintings cover the wall, so much you can barely see the white of it.  These
are all pictures of the previous mayors of the city.  For some reason it
seems a mayor in this town does not serve a long term.  Either the kenders
all want to take turns running the town business, or would rather be playing
than working.  You can exit back out to the west or go south and say hello
to the mayor himself.  The plaque outside did say anyone was welcome.

soft chuckle.  He says to you " Hello friend, welcome to Paravallen, how
might I be of service " and then with another giggle he sits down in a chair
and starts to fiddle with a piece of wood he has in his hand.  If there were
such things as living puppets who could talk, this guy would surely qualify.

You arrive from the south to find what is one of the cleanest stables you
have ever seen.  There is not a sign of scattered hay, or the smell of
filthy animals lingering in the air.  You are not quite sure what kind of
creatures are kept here to make this place so presentable or if the owner
just makes it a must to keep up the place.  Regardless this is the place to
come when wanting to head out for adventure.  The only exit from here is
back out the south door.

Name Khoal's House of Necromancy~
Descr
As you enter this shop, you are immediately assaulted be a number of
revolting smells and sights. The acrid smell of burning herbs and flesh
linger in the room. Like an oppressive fog, smoke hangs around you,
distorting the weak meager lighting emminating from some source on the
opposite side of the room. Making your way to the back of the shop, you
weave and stumble over tables and large stacks of books. Upon the tables
you make out what appears to be sheets of leather, it also appears that
these sheets are made from all sorts of races. Small skulls adorn the 
sides of a cabinet on the west side of the room. You can't help but
examine the skulls, as some sort of morbid fascination overcomes you.
By the shapes and sizes you guess these are probably Kender skulls.
Revulsion overcomes your curiousity and you continue to the rear of
the store, attempting not to look around you anymore. Once at the rear
of the shop you see the light source is a black wax candle sticking out
of a pure ebony skull. You shudder at this sight and look up at the
figure behind the counter.

odd paintings of scribes doing various activities, and a few yellowed
parchments that are to dust covered to read.  You peer towards the back of a
shop and see a hobled form sitting behind the counter smiling at you. 
Behind her there are many cubby holes built into the wall with many scrolls
and other parchments sticking out of them.  Two candle holders straddle the
desk and a long thick candle sitting squarly in the center, provide the only
light.

The sound of sawing fill your ears as you enter this shop. A wide and well
lit room greats you. Rows of A-frame racks adorned with a wide variety of
canoes and other small crafts. The smell of oil hangs in the room, due to the
number of skin boats. Off to the left you see a stout Kender sawing with
vigour on a piece of hardened cherrywood, it would seem if he was making
a head peice for the newly finished dingy sitting near by. The floor seems
coverd with a sort of, saw-dust/skin hardened with a waterproofing oil.
No doubt the place hasn't been cleaned in quite some time. The shopkeeper
notices you looking around and waves you over to him with a hearty smile.

staffs crossed above the doorway. The plaque on the shop reads
 
              " Gibbles Place - No Soliciting Allowed "
 
Maybe this answers why it is so quiet in this section. The shop owner
sounds as if he is a cranky one. Maybe it would be better to head back
west and leave this guy alone. Then again those hoopaks seem to indicate
it is a weapons shop of some sort. This could be just what you were 
looking for.

The kenders of Paravallen, have made it a habit to do business with

at an large barbarian trying to overpower a small kender and take his purse.
Before you can react a guardian of the city rushes in from the north and
subdues the large grunt.  The guardians seem to have been well trained to
deal with such circumstances like this.  It is wise that you do not try to
mess with the folk.

A rather bare shop, walls lined with sturdy shelves holding vials and
beakers.  The wooden floors creak as if protesting your weight upon it.  The
sound of the outdoor Bazaar waft in through the cloth curtain that serves as
the front door.  An open window to the left of the door serves as the main
source of light, but is covered with a white stained cloth, a light breeze
outside makes the cloth flutter therefor casting strange shadows about the
room.  You get the unnerving feeling that the shadows aren't totally due to
the lighting.  A rather plain looking kender female sits at a table watching
you, seeming amused at your interest in the shadows, she motions you over.

Name Before a Large Tent~
Descr
You are standing on a large rug that has been laid out on the ground
apparently for adventurers to wipe they're feet on before heading south
into the large tent. A sign is set next to the tent that reads
 
 Welcome To Wilkeys ! Please be so kind to wipe your feet before
entering this fine establishment, we try our best to be clean. "
 
Well at the looks of this the owner must be a kender of this town. They
tend to insist on keeping everything tidy around the them.

Name South End of the Bazaar~
Descr
A bird darts down from the sky grabbing a piece of bread of the ground,
and immediately flies back up into a tree.  You can understand why it would
be harder to keep up the city in this section, due to all the crowds that
come through here each day in large numbers.  The walk continues east and
west from here.

Name South East End of Bazaar~
Descr
Looking around you can see an alley that seems to lead out of the bazaar
to he north.  To the west the path leads into the great bazaar of
paravallen.  You might not want to travel any further though because looking
south is a small hut with a bronze shield hanging from it.  This indicates
that it is an armor shop of some sorts.

Descr
Shortly after entering this shop, you are startled by a wooden frame
wearing a full suit of plate battle armor. Recovering from your initial
shock you notice that this armor is of exceptional quallity. You round
the wooden Knight and are amazed to see an entire row of stick figures
wearing various peices of armor of different types, leather armor being
the majority, however a few fine peices of plate and mail also protect
their wooden sentries. An impatiant Kender yells for you to stop drooling
on his armor.

Name Short Cut Through an Alley~
Descr
You are taking a short cut through an alley that connects the bazaar to
outer streets of the city.  It looks as if this section has been ill kept by
the folk of the town.  Rats skitter by your feet, and roaches have they're
way with the trash on the ground.  It is dark and musty here.  You can hear
the loud bustle of the bazaar coming from the west.

table.  Flowers of all sorts sit in various vases, releasing a fresh sweet
sent into the air.  A glass display case has many bracelets and rings, the
light reflects off the highly polished weddeing ring, giving it the
appearance of winking at you.  A rather lovely looking Kender smiles warmly
at you.

Name Gibbles Weapons of Destruction~
Descr
Large racks of weapons adorn the walls, everything from the hoopak (the
traditional Kender weapon), to very large two-handed swords. A display
case in the center tantalizes the warrior in everyone with a wide variety
of hand weapons, small handheld maces, wickedly spiked mourning stars,
single and double bladed hand axes. Everything a Kender warrior would need
and then SOME! You notice the shop is very tidy, not a spec of dirt on the
hard tile floors, the shelves and the display cases were immaculatly clean.
All the steal shined, and even the wood on the weapons seemed polished.
It would appear that the owner of this shop cares about his posessions.

Name Wilkey's Fine Drink~

As you enter the tent you notice many people sitting at tables and bars,
sipping brews of all kinds.  The thick smell of ale hangs in the air, making
you rather thirsty for a taste of the fine mead.  Wine barrels line the back
walls and a small Kender boy runs hastily attempting to fill up several mugs
with the crimson liqued.  A few loud humans laugh merrily at some private
joke, obviously extremely drunk.  All in all, everyone looks like they are a
mighty good time.
