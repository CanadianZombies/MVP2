ExtraDescr diary~
Day 1, Month of Carnage Daeo - The days have been long since the starting


of carving a way through the mountain side.  We have gone 20 feet into


the mountainside without any problem.  The other dwarves are lagging behind,


but no trouble, I can manage myself with the help of my fellow half-giants.


============================================================================


Day 3, Month of Carnage Daeo - Many of the workers have come to our camp


site outside of this cave drunk and delireous.  Things started getting


serious when reports and citings of dragons are heard by mouth from some


older workers here.  The cave we have dug is not even half done.  If the


other dwarves continue with the habit they have acquired, this dig will 


never get done.


============================================================================


Day 6, Month of Carnage Daeo - Other dwarves have finally taken this dig


seriously.  We have been finding ancient artifacts of dark and evil druidic


worship, but these remains have been here for over 200 or more years.  The


sitings of dragons increase.  I have no fear, we have over 16 warriors here


that are guarding us against the orcs, and over 20 mages here that guard us


from anything else.  I laugh in the face of dragons!


============================================================================


Day 9, Month of Carnage Daeo - We have only accomplished 25% of our 


original plan even with people working hard.  This morning, a dragon was


defeated but due to a casualty.  These black dragons are deadly, and a mage


sacrificed his life to save his other fellow friends.  Today we held a short


funeral for the brave soul.  


=============================================================================


Day 11, Month of Carnage Daeo - All work has stopped on the dig.  We are now


evacuating the site because of over 10 sitings of black dragons.  So far,


a total of 3 good fighters, and 10 mages have died.  We cannot sustain the


attack and growth of the black dragons.  I have build this secret room in


anything happens to us on our evacuation.


==============================================================================


Day 13, Month of Carnage Daeo - On our evacuation, 5 black dragons have 


attacked us.  We lost all our mages and all our fighters.  The fight was


gruesome, and hurt us bad.  We took them down with us though.  We have


almost half of the population who started on the dig with us.  The dragons


have blocked our evacuation and I am forced to live in this secret room


with my other friends.  The black dragons have populated most of the 


cave now and are making their homes here.  


=============================================================================


Day 15, Month of Carnage Daeo - Many of my friends have gone insane and


left the saftey of the secret room i have made.  I do not know what fate


has laid upon them, but i am glad that i will not suffer at the hands of a 


black dragon.


=============================================================================


Day 19, Month of Carnage Daeo - Food shortage out.  Ink running out.  Dying


of starvation.  Cannot leave room, dragons coming in & out of cave.  Eyesight


going out.  Anyone who finds this diary, help me continue riddence of cave.


Find out fate of dwarven race.  Find mother and talk.
