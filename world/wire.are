Name Along the Cells~
Descr
The hall is cool and the draft flows in from the north.  Moans can be
heard along the hall way.  As you get to the end of the hall, you look back
and notice it is at a slight incline going down.  There are cells on the
west and east sides of the hall.  The hall continues to the north.

Small kids around age 7 are standing up and whacking at a 2 foot in
radius tree.  Older kids are whacking at one about 6 foor in radius.  You
wonder why they would give these boys such large trees, but think it is none
of your buisness.  An older man is here shouting at the kids.
