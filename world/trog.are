Name Road to Kaazor~
Descr
You are walking down a very large tunnel.  The sign identified this road
as the road to Kaazor.  Now legend says that Kaazor was raised in this town
right here.  But when he grew he realised that the way his people were going
was not the right path.  So he taught his people to love the enemies as
brothers he also spoke out in blaspemy against the troglodytes gods and said
there was only one god and we were to serve him.  He continued to preach and
gather a large crowd until he was violently murdered by the temple priests.
