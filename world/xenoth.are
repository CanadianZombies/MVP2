Name The Great Anorien Plains~
Descr
The Great Anorien Plains stand before you, they seem like a vast endless
field of tall wavering grass. There are deer prancing around here, and you
can see buffalo grazing on the tall grass. This field seems to follow the
Minhiriath Road, which you can see a ways to the north. These plains continue
to the north, south, east, and west stretching over a vast area of land.
