Name The Northern Ocean~
Descr
You are in the Great Northern Ocean. You spot random seagulls, and
sometimes schools of fish near the surface, but besides that, hardly nothing
else. Occasionally, a ship ventures across the vast ocean, but many old
wives tales have described of how many ships that have attempted to have
never been seen again. These tales have also talked about a lost city of
Atlantis, and a haunted ship that roams the oceans.

Name The Northern Ocean~
Descr
You are in the Great Northern Ocean. You spot random seagulls, and
sometimes schools of fish near the surface, but besides that, hardly nothing
else. Occasionally, a ship ventures across the vast ocean, but many old
wives tales have described of how many ships that have attempted to have
never been seen again. These tales have also talked about a lost city of
Atlantis, and a haunted ship that roams the oceans.

Name On the Shores of the Northern Ocean~
Descr
You are on the shore of the great Northern Ocean. This part of the beach
is sandy, and the waves come up almost to a great natural wall. Every once
in awhile you notice a crab hurry by, but on the most part, there is nothing
noticable alive except you. For as far as you can see out to sea, you see
nothing but more ocean.
