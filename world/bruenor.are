Name Lair of the Master Dread~
Descr
The room got quite a bit bigger here and is somewhat in order compared to
the other room.  Claw marks are still visable as the walls aren't smoothed
off.  The foul smell of rotting flesh and rotting carcasses fill the room. 
A few arms and legs lie piled up in the northwestern corner of the room
(some human, others unrecognized) still in one piece.

Name Inside the Huge Waterhole~
Descr
Swimming around in the huge waterhold is quite enjoyable.  The water is a
pleasant temperature and a few colorful fish swim nearby.  A strange
vibrating can be felt every five to ten seconds.  Your instincts kick in and
tell you there is danger near.

Name Bottom of the Huge Waterhole~
Descr
You have reached the bottom of the hole and are quite a ways from the
surface.  It's grown dark from the depth and dark shapes swim around
replacing the colorful fish that were above.  One shape in particular sticks
out because of it's size.
