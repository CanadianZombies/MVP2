Name In a Strange Old Elevator~
Descr
You are in an old abandoned elevator. It was probably used by the miners
ages ago. You are astounded that they had elevators that long ago, but by
closer observation, you see that it is only a simple pully system. Staying
here much longer might be hazardous to your health, due to the fact that
this elevator will probably fall at any time.

Name A Side Hall in the Bandit Camp~
Descr
Here is an old mined out shaft deep in the Northern Caves. Ancient
pickaxes, rusted and rotten, can be found every once in awhile. The dwarfs
used to mine here for diamonds, most of them just turned into pricey
trinkets. But every once in awhile, they found magical diamonds, and they
used them to fight back against the forces of evil. It appears that bandits
are using these caves to hide in while they aren't out stealing. They will
probably greet you if you come in, but you had better watch your purse.
