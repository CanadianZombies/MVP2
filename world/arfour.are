ExtraDescr paper~
Not long ago there was a Weaponsmith by the name of Drakkar.  He was by

far the best Weaponsmith in existence to date.  He could make a childs toy

that had the ability to slay in 1 hit.  Luckly he was good natured and never

did those types of things.  When Drakkar would grow tired of smithing for

people and for himself He would goto Xylar or explore the lands for a time

until his wanderlust wore off and he'd head home to make more weapons.  On

one of his many trips to Xylar he made an awful mistake.  While he was there

he decided to stay for a day or two.  This just happen to be the same day

Vallis T'Klure the Orc Menace had decided to raid Xylar and pillage, and

loot etc etc.  Well Vallis not being a stupid person(Well not for an Orc

anyway) seized the moment, and seized Drakkar.  After there little escapaid

Vallis returned to Masqe with Drakkar.  Taking Drakkar to a small cell near

his home Vallis forced Drakkar to forge him a weapon that could pierce even

the scale of a might Black Dragon.  Drakkar being the kind man he was said

he'd do it but for a fee.  If he made the Dragonlance after 5 years Vallis

must turn it over to a Dragon to guard for the rest of Eternity or until the

dragon dies.  Vallis also being one of his word agree'd to this.  Thus this

is how the Dragonlance was born.  Well after 5 years had passed and Vallis

was turning over the lance there was a slight complication.  If a dragon

touched the lance he was severly injured.  So Vallis was forced to find a

man to guard the lance WITH the dragons.  25 years have passed and suddenly

sightings of a man with a massive blood-encrusted lance have swept over the

land.  It is said this is the dragonlance and that the dragon and rider are

the man and a dragon set to guard the lance.  The only problem with these

sightings are that the man is doing unspeakable things with the lance to

people.  Killing them massacres and slaughters abound.  Be you weary

adventurer willing and courages enough to go find the lance there is also

another special item known to be held by the rider.  Gauntlets forged to go

with the lance are located somewhere near where the dragon is hidden.  Only

one person knows where the cave that holds these monsters is and only you

can save the rest of the world from there wrath.

trail that looks well used.  A few spears stuck in the ground show that
someone may have lived here and gotten attacked or fled.  The shack is much
closer now and shows that it has been well kept thru time.

Here the forest ends and a trail begins.  All around you are blackened
flowers and trees.  It looks as if a huge fireball spell was cast and
accidently hit a field or two.  South the trail extends to a small shack.
