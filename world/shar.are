skirmish outside the city of Bythar, with the forces of Bythus overwhelming
the forces of good.  The hallway continues east, to a foyer of sorts, and to
the west.

Name A Castle Hallway~
Descr
As you walk along these castle hallways you notice that whoever designed
them must not have had much imagination.  The walls all have the exact same
size brick with torches fixed into the wall at exact intervals.  The only
thing that keeps you from mind numbing boredom is the tapestries, many of
which show exciting scenes from the past.  A depiction of the creation of
darkelves and orcs by Bythus and Krag, the dark lord, leaves you gaping in
awe.  To the west is a door while the hallway leads north and to the south a
stairway up can be seen.

wield.  Shaking that thought out of your head you notice that the hallway
leads north and south, each the same diatance from a tower, while to the

Unlike the rest of the castle hallways this one is larger and more

predict a future more than show the past.  Here you see Whelm destroying or
taking over every major and minor outpost and town in the known world.  Also
the final tapestry in this section shows Whelm sitting upon his throne with
the world in the palm of his hand.  It's not very hard to see what his
future goals are.  This hallway goes to the south back to the foyer and
north to some sort of hall.  You also see doors both to the east and to the
west.

Name Karn's Bedroom~
Descr
Unlike the Captain of the Guard the leiutenant must have had to combine
office and sleeping quarters in one.  Here you see a desk.  A bed, a chair
along with various things strewn about the room.  It seems that the
leiutenant doesn't care about order as much as the captain.

Name The Bedroom of Ari Ben Canna~

Surely this is the quarters of a mage.  Bits of arcane matter and books

and talismans of unknown origin are hung around in seemingly no order or
pattern, but with a mage who knows..  The door leads back to the hallway

You are now standing in the massive Hall of Whelm the Destroyer.  It is
nearly 100 feet across and almost 50 feet high.  It is decorated with many
tapestries and the trophies of many kills, including those of some legendary
heros you have been told about.  To the north sits a dias with two thrones,
made of gold and encrusted with gems, made for a king or one who would call
himself king.  At the east and west ends of this hall you see passageways
off to other rooms while to the south is the hallway back to the foyer.

still covering it.  Much of the room is decorated in a similar fashion, with
skulls and corpses either covered in blood or gold plated.  To the west is

From this lookout tower you can easily see why the castle is hidden so

castle.  If there is anything to the south of this castle then it too is
also well hidden for you cannot see anything else for miles around.  To the
north and west are walls that lead to the other corner parapets while down
takes you back to the castle proper.

Off in the distance you can make out the mountain near Masque and
