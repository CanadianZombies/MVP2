Name figure guardian floating forest~
Short forest guardian~
Long 
A floating figure is here acting as a forest guardian.
~
Descr
When you look at this figure you can not tell if it is male or female. 
For that matter you really can not see much more than the robe it is
wearing.  The robe itself is an almost-evil black, but you sense nothing
evil from the figure.  You sense nothing at all.

Short I'akalam the Fire Druid~
Long 
A man in a flaming robe meditates here.
~
Descr
I'akalam looks to be so devoted to the element of fire that his hair and
eyes have turned red.  His robe is indeed on fire, yet the flames do not
consume it.  His almost expressionless face almost hurts to look at as he
gazes scronfully at you.

Franteshn looks like a very old and wise man.  His sits on top of this
hill like a king of all that lives on the ground.  His chants are not like
anything you have heard, much like the rest of this place.

fel that she may be the most powerful.  Her body is covered by a deep-blue
robe that commands you to think of the ocean.  Her hands are delicate, but
they look very cold.

This "being" apears to be made of pure stone, but then again you can see
right through it.  It is careful to not hit the altar as it flies, so you
gather that it is tangible, although it looks much tougher that you.

This forest druid is literally worshiping the ground you walk on, however
you get the distinct impression he would continue to do this if you weren't
here.  There is nothing very interesting about him, other than the fact that
he is quite naked.  Well that is interesting, oh well back to nature!

of somesort, it is very hard to tell from where you stand.  There are two

You are hovering next to a large tree.  To the west there is a large
enough clearing to fly in and proceed up to the tree house.  Of course you

west, east, and south.  You start to wonder why not the north, but maybe the
breeze from there makes up for it.
