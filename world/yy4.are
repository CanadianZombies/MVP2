Name unholy guardian aone~
Short an unholy guardian~
Long 
An unholy guardian patrols these passages, looking for intruders like you.
~
Descr
Standing well over 7 feet tall this being looks as if it were a cross
between an orc and a troll, combining the worst features of each.  It's eyes
are glassed over and by it's very apperance and nature you decide that this
thing has but one purpose in life...  To kill.

Short an unholy beast of terror~
Long 
A large, stiff-haired, black monster is here sniffing you out.
~
Descr
This creature resembles a large wolf, if said wolf came from the very
bowels of hell.  It's thick fur seems almost razor sharp and the liquid
dripping from it's fangs doesn't look to healthy either.  In any event it
does not seem to be in the best interests to antagonize this creature in any
way.

Descr
A small azeblo, well at least as azeblo go, wanders around here trying to
stick close to the wall.  He is very good at this although he doesn't seem
to realize yet that you have spotted him.  He seems to be eyeing you,
checking you out to see how much of a threat you are.  Now the question is
are you going to give him something to worry about?

~
Descr
In the orcish language 'azeblo' means champion and you can see why these
creatures here are called azeblo.  Standing a full head and shoulders above
any orc you have ever seen this azeblo seems ready to take on a whole hoard
of elves.  Surprisingly he doesn't seem as savage as most orcs, nor as
aggressive.  IF you didn't know any better you would think that he is almost
civilized.

and you are sure that such dedication is not earned without possesing the
skills to carry out said duty.

Blocking your way east is this azeblo standing in front of you.  He holds
in his hand a large, wicked looking spear made entirely of iron and it looks
as if he knows how to use it.  The way that he grasps it makes you feel as
if he might even sleep with that spear, so dedicated is he to protecting his
chief.

A huge, intelligent looking azeblo gives you the once over as you walk in.
~
Descr
If this was a regular orc you would be absolutely stunned at the sheer
size of him and even as an azeblo he is still the largest member of his race
you have ever encountered.  You notice scars here and there but they are not
very numerous, and you wonder if that is because he does not fight much or
because he fights so well.  Do you take the chance and try to find out?

bit of blood and marrow sucked from his body.  While the body may be weak
inside you can sense a deep, burning, unholy fire that makes this thing
stronger than it ever should be.

long from nose to back, not including it's tail, and almost as high.  OK, so

This spider must have been born and raised underneath this mountain. 
It's exoskeleton is paler than bones bleached in the sun for many years and
it's eyes are wider than any spider you have seen before.  Of course the
mandibles are nothing new but still something to be feared with that viscous
poison that lurks in the maw of most spiders in this land.

Here before you stands a legend, a creature that abhors the light and
feeds of the blood of the still living.  Known as vampires, little is known
about them, only that they did not exist in this world until very recently. 
How this happened, or why, is still unknown but here it is in front of you. 
This one looks as if it has neet seen a civilzed place in a long time, the
clothes upon his back in rags and the skin paler than the moon itself.  It
looks at you with both fear and hunger and you wonder which decision this
vampire will come to.

with feeling that everything in your life was too extreme and that you must
balance it in some way.  Such is the power of this figure, to make sure that
none go to far in any direction so that the peace and harmony that holds
this world together will be preserved.  Why would it be down here though,
when there are places that are more extreme, places that would better
benifit from this figures influence.  There must be more to these tunnels

closer however you see that it goes much farther than this, Landslide is
actually composed of stone himself.  Even with that you notice that he moves
without the slowness of other rock creatures you have seen, and without the

As you walk along these twisty tunnels you suddenly come up to a blank
wall.  Luckily, or maybe unluckily, there is a passage that leads off to one
side.  You think to yourself, "Great, a blind turn in a blind maze where
everything looks the same.  How am I gonna get outta here?"  Oh well, better
just plod along and get through this before any of the denizins decide that
you should be their next meal.

The passage quickly stops in front of you.  All around you except the way
you came you are surrounded by rock, which you would swear is the same rock
you just passed, and passed before that.  Hopefully you can make it back out
of this spot and get back on the right path, whatever that may be, before
whatever creature that live in these tunnels track you down and kill you.

Here the tunnel bends leading east towards a cave of some sort and south
the tunnel just continues along it's crooked path.  You see that this spot
has been set-up to be some sort of guard post, with loose rubble heaped up
upon the sides making the passage narrow and hard to negotiate.

This passage continues along in the same direction you just came from. 
Checking out your surroundings you notice that this section looks remarkably
similar to every other passage you've gone through.  You feel that you could
get lost very easily.  It does seem however that the sounds of the
indigenous inhabitants are getting closer and closer so you better get out
of here quick.

The passage quickly stops in front of you.  All around you except the way
you came you are surrounded by rock, which you would swear is the same rock
you just passed, and passed before that.  Hopefully you can make it back out
of this spot and get back on the right path, whatever that may be, before
whatever creature that live in these tunnels track you down and kill you.

As you walk along these twisty tunnels you suddenly come up to a blank
wall.  Luckily, or maybe unluckily, there is a passage that leads off to one
side.  You think to yourself, "Great, a blind turn in a blind maze where
everything looks the same.  How am I gonna get outta here?"  Oh well, better
just plod along and get through this before any of the denizins decide that
you should be their next meal.

Definately living quarters of some sort it seems that it has been set up

so you are as lost as you were before.  Your best bet would be to just

side.  You think to yourself, "Great, a blind turn in a blind maze where
everything looks the same.  How am I gonna get outta here?"  Oh well, better
just plod along and get through this before any of the denizins decide that
you should be their next meal.

This passage continues along in the same direction you just came from. 
Checking out your surroundings you notice that this section looks remarkably
similar to every other passage you've gone through.  You feel that you could
get lost very easily.  It does seem however that the sounds of the
indigenous inhabitants are getting closer and closer so you better get out
of here quick.

All of the passages here converge and head off in three seperate
directions, and in this case form a T.  A straight passage with another
partitioning it at a 90 degree angle.  Now this might be useful to know
except that every other three way intersection looked exactly the same and
so you are as lost as you were before.  Your best bet would be to just
choose one of the passages before any of those noises around you come any

Name A Straight Passage~
Descr
This passage continues along in the same direction you just came from. 
Checking out your surroundings you notice that this section looks remarkably
similar to every other passage you've gone through.  You feel that you could
get lost very easily.  It does seem however that the sounds of the
indigenous inhabitants are getting closer and closer so you better get out
of here quick.

As you walk along these twisty tunnels you suddenly come up to a blank
wall.  Luckily, or maybe unluckily, there is a passage that leads off to one
side.  You think to yourself, "Great, a blind turn in a blind maze where
everything looks the same.  How am I gonna get outta here?"  Oh well, better
just plod along and get through this before any of the denizins decide that
you should be their next meal.

The passage quickly stops in front of you.  All around you except the way
you came you are surrounded by rock, which you would swear is the same rock
you just passed, and passed before that.  Hopefully you can make it back out
of this spot and get back on the right path, whatever that may be, before
whatever creature that live in these tunnels track you down and kill you.

All of the passages here converge and head off in three seperate
directions, and in this case form a T.  A straight passage with another
partitioning it at a 90 degree angle.  Now this might be useful to know
except that every other three way intersection looked exactly the same and
so you are as lost as you were before.  Your best bet would be to just
choose one of the passages before any of those noises around you come any
closer.

This passage continues along in the same direction you just came from. 
Checking out your surroundings you notice that this section looks remarkably
similar to every other passage you've gone through.  You feel that you could
get lost very easily.  It does seem however that the sounds of the
indigenous inhabitants are getting closer and closer so you better get out
of here quick.

Name A Dead End~
Descr
The passage quickly stops in front of you.  All around you except the way
you came you are surrounded by rock, which you would swear is the same rock
you just passed, and passed before that.  Hopefully you can make it back out
of this spot and get back on the right path, whatever that may be, before
whatever creature that live in these tunnels track you down and kill you.

This is strange.  After walking around with only two choices, going ahead
or going back, you actually have a real decision to make.  The passages head
off north, south and west.  Which way to go is not exactly clear here as all
of the choices look pretty much the same.

Having moved the boulder and entering the space that it used to occupy
you now find yourself in a tunnel carved out of the mountain itself.  It
seems natural but in the back of your mind there is just one lingering doubt
that maybe it isn't so natural at all.

that comes down this path must head into the cave.

However, slight scraping sounds can still be heard from the other side.
