This room is extremely dark.  The only light in here is a strange dark
light which pulsates from the smooth black walls.  Standing in this light
makes you feel very uneasy and somehow different.  The darkness is really

Name Swimming in the Slime~
Descr
There is a greenish slime all around you.  A little bit of light shines
down through the muck from above you.  Looking around you can only see the
vial green slime.  With closer examination you notice chunks in that slime,
some of which just float with the muck, while others seem to be moving by
their own power.  Exits lead in all directions, but the nicest looking one
is up.

Name Asmodeus's Abaddon.~
Descr
You are in the deepest depths of hell.  A place of complete and utter
destruction.  This is also Asmodeus's favorite place to hang out.  The
torture that has been done in this room is unimagionable.  Twisted and
mangled bodies litter the floor.  Unspeakably disgusting and abhoaring
torture machines line the walls.  In the center of the room there is a
throne made of living flesh.  You are lucky though if no one sits upon that
throne.  And hey, if someone is sitting there atleast you won't have a very
far trip to your final resting place!
