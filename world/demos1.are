was obviously a great mage of the realm, but no inscription have been left


to identify him.  His robes are covered with strange and most obviously


magic runes and his staff seems to have been an object of great power.  His


face shows great age and looking into his eyes you can almost see his deep


inner wisdom and knowledge.  A long beard tumbles down the front of his


chest and his hair is very thin.

You are deep within the black forest.  Dying trees and plants surround
you and the smell of decay and rot hangs thick in the air here.  Thorny
locust trees line the path and make it dangerous to leave it, less you be
mangled and torn by thier thick black spikes that jut from thier branches
and trunks.

The narrow path through the forest continues here and opens up into a
large clearing to the north.  The thorny locust trees hang close to the
trail, seemingly trying to get a chance to scratch you and draw blood. 
Small dying shrubs line the path close to the ground and the smell of
decaying foliage burns your nose.
