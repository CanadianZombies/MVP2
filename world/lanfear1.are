A 20-foot monstrous creature stands here.

ExtraDescr diary~
This book, torn and bloodied tells a tragic tale of dark priests, who in

their ignorance, released the Balrog upon the world. They have managed to

keep it entraped in the surrounding forest, but were unable to kill it or

drive it back before it laid waste to them. 

~
ExtraDescr diary~
Blood-covered and partially burnt, not much of this diary is legible. However,

one entry that can be made out reads, "Two more days... two more days and I

shall summon forth the beast that will give us the power to destroy those who

would seek to eliminate us. It has been many years since I found the parchment

that described the beast, known simple as 'Balrog' but if all goes in accordance

with my plans, the next full moon will see the dawning of a new world order...

 

 

ShriKreen, High Priest of Marasol."

 

Another entry follows this one,

 

"Rennard has returned with the neccessary supplies needed for the opening

of the gateway to hell. The priests are gathering from throughout the land,

and preparations are underway... Dark gods willing, we shall see the birth

of a new reign of terror tonight!"

 

The last entry in the book is hard to read, due to both the condition of the

book and the troubles the author is having keeping his writing legible.

 

"Terrible, Rennard dead, the circle of priests dragged into the pit. Balrog

is much more powerful than we had originally planned. He broke through our

circles of warding as if they were tissue paper. With him came his minions,

terrible beasts who obey his every command unquestioningly. I have little

strength left in me - I fear my wound is mortal, but I must pen this in hopes

that someone comes along and reads it. Balrog must be stopped, he is pure

evil and..."

 

The entry ends here, the writer evidentally running out of strength.

~
ExtraDescr daythree~
The writing of this day is harried, as if the author is rushed...

 

"Two more days.... two more days and I shall summon forth the beast that will

give us the power to destroy those who would seek to eliminate us. It has

been many years since I found the parchment that described the beast, known

~
ExtraDescr diary~
The diary seems to have suffered greatly over the years, only the last

few days are legible, the rest having been burnt badly or covered in what

you can only assume is human blood. (look daythree, daytwo, dayone for the

last 3 entries)

This cavern is like none you've ever seen before. Alternating black and

Here and there are scattered cots upon which the pitiful creatures rest when
not fighting for the balrog's amusement. Moans and groans can be heard from
the few survivors of the last fight.

Name Beginning of the Escape Passage~
Descr
You see here an indication of the poor conditions that these people have to 
face. Rather than continue to kill for the Balrog's amusement - a tunnel
has been started here as a means of escape. Using nothing more than their
bare hands, the tunnel winds to the south.

Name A Branch in the Stairs~

To the east of you is a doorway set in the tunnel wall. However, what it

the east. Coupled with this stench are loud, seemingly drunk voices raised
in what the tone-deaf might call a song.

Name Deep in a Dark Forest~
Descr
The forest is quiet - too quiet. It seems as if a dark presence has taken
hold of this forest an driven out the animals. Silence reigns supreme in the
forest, and in the periphery of your vision, you'd swear you could see dark
demonic shapes following you.

Name A Secluded Glade in the Forest~
Descr
You get the feeling that you are the first people to walk here in a long time
Dewy grass underfoot, and large oak trees overhead, the glade would be a 
peaceful place were it not for the aura of evil that hangs heavy in the air.
To the west you see what seem to be large blocks or boulders.

Name Remains of an Ancient Church~
Descr
You feel a great feeling of disquiet upon entering what appears to be the
remains of a once-large church. Tapestries crumble to dust at your touch,
and of the former residents of this church, all that can be seen is an altar
at the north end of the church, glowing brightly.

Name Altar of an Ancient Church~

The altar is in surprisingly good condition considering the state of the

including the summoning of demons and other creatures of the netherworld. On
top of the altar seems to be a book.
