Name A Floating Spawning Pool~
Descr
Floating in the void is a large pool that mimics the feels and smells of
a swamp. The water itself floats in a plasmic field like dust in a gravity
well. Inside the pool are small bodies squiggling in their own filth. The
water, disgustingly odorous, is near the temperature of boiling.
