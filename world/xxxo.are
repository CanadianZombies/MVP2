Descr
The wall of stone to your north is showing some signs of age.  An
occasional stone fallen off revealing gaps in the wall.  A small bird
chirping nearby, and the rustle of a small animal in the nearby brush
enhance the pleasantness of this spot.

Name Before an abandoned building~
Descr
The lane ends here before an immense building, that could accuratley be
called a mansion.  The huge porch with a gaping hole where the front doors
used to be lies to the north.  On either side you see a bit of a clearing
around the house, where a lush lawn no doubt once thrived, but now has given
way to the forest.  To leave this dismal place, the road south beckons.

Name Front porch~

This porch appears able to bear weight, as the floorboards look sound,

Name Damaged porch~
Descr
This end of the porch looks less sturdy, as the years of rain coming thru
the hole in the porch roof has caused some major erosion and warpage.  To
the east you could crawl down and get to the side of the house, and west
lies a sturdier portion of this once fine veranda.

Name Front porch~

The porch simply is, in that most taoist of ways.  Nothing more, nothing

Name Main entrance~
Descr
A dark staircase looms directly in front of you, leading up into the
murky reaches.  This room was once a grand entrance hall, now the winds and
rains have reduced it to a simple <place>.  To the west, once splendid oak
doors hang splintered to pieces, giving you a glimpse into the room beyond. 
The archway to the right is marred with huge black streaks, and the frame is
buckled.

From here you can see that the mansion is not only large on the front

awaiting the adventurous soul within.  However, there is still that nagging
worry about what tore down the gate, and blasted through the doors.  Ah, but

down to the area lying just to the south of you.
