Name vlad spawn vampire~
Short Vlad~
Long 
Vlad, spawn of Caine, looks at you and decides you are not worth killing.
~
Descr
From the stories you have heard you expected Vlad to be 50 feet tall and
ready to kill you at a glance.  This figure does not match the legend, he is
of average human height and except for a slight paleness could pass for one
easily.  He sits here, not acknowledging your presence but just looking at
you, as one would look upon insects.

Name dr doctor sepato hunter extraordinare aone~
Short Doctor Sepato~
Long 
Dr. Sepato, hunter extraordinare, stands here arguing with Gryshnik.
~
Descr
There is nothing really special to note about Doctor Sepato except for
the his eyes, which seem as if he has seen the worst the world could offer,
and for far too long.  While the outward appearance does not suggest power
his inner soul does as well as the experience of the ages.

Gryshnik is here, arguing with Dr. Sepato.
~
Descr
Definitely what you would have to call a large man is here before you. 
Not fat, but strong muscle fill out this frame.  He seems young, perhaps
just out of adolesence, and with that you can sense the brash cockiness that
comes with being that age.

Short Malkavious~
Long 
Malkavious, leader of clan Malkavian, stands here looking at you.
~
Descr
This vampire looks as if he is ready to go off to war, and is always at
full battle readiness.  Possibly the largest vampire you have ever seen, and
the faint scars on his body attest to his battle prowess considering the
amazing healing properties of vampires.

Short Toreadontes~
Long 
Toreadontes, leader of clan Toreador, stands here.
~
Descr
Toreadontes could be the most beautiful creature you have ever seen,
except that beneath the outer beauty lies a cold black heart.  She is made
up in fashions and make-up that are perfect for her and unlike many vampires
there is a sweet scent about her, masking the stench of the undead.

The one you look upon is very sensual and attractive, not in pure
physicality but in the way she holds herself.  She is an artist and her

she is succeding.

If it is true that the nosferatu get more and more perverted in form the
older and more powerful they get than this one must be very old and
powerful.  As beautiful as the toreador are this one is ugly, and you feel a
need to do something about it.

this vampire is part of that force for clan malkavian.

~
Descr
Unlike the other toreador vampires this one is not so concerned with
apperance, although it is still better than most vampires, but more in the
artistry of her battle skills.  She finds beauty in her attacks and spells
and she would like nothing better than for you to give her reason to show
you.

A large, ugly vampire strolls through the tunnels.
~
Descr
It's almost difficult to tell that this is a vampire, what with all the
cuts and scars upon this already disfigured body.  While not military like
the malkavians the nosferatu have a militia type force it counts upon, and
while not pretty to look at this vampire looks quite capable of doing that
job.

powerful, just less so than the elders.

idea what the argument is about.  If you head north you can go explore some
tunnels in darkness.

You cannot imagine anything intelligent living like this, in such squalor

organic and inorganic, scattered about haphazerdly.  The walls are also

Unlike most of what you have encountered underneath the Dertovian
mountains this area is fairly large, and must be living quarters of some
sort from the sorry excuse for bedding you see lying around.  Near as you
can tell this is not natural since archways lead to the next caverns and
they appear to be built, rather than naturaly formed.

As you look at the walls of the cavern you can barely tell what was upon
them for they have been drawn over so many times it is impossible to tell
one image from another.  Fortunately, from what you can make out, this is a
good thing.  To the west the passage gets larger and almost becomes cavern
like.

The beautiful artwork that you started at the north has become more

Also much of it has also been decorated over and it is no longer pleasant to

Name The Malkavian Tunnels~
Descr
As you wander around these tunnels you half expect someone to jump out of
some hidden niche, as these tunnels seem perfect for that sort of thing. 
Hopefully you are just visiting here and not on the practice roster.

Strange, It seems as if you have been here before, yet it also seems
different somehow.  A person could get lost here with all the twists and
turns, and you think you might be one of those people.

Gone are the coffins that you occasionaly saw to the north, instead this
seems more like a battle-ground of some sort.  Every so often you think you
hear the sounds of metal upon metal, but you can't be quite sure.

These tunnels that wrap around itself in strange ways seem perfect for

As you approach the temple you can tell that it is not a building in

of course it's depth is unknown.

Name Towards the Great Temple~
Descr
Taking a closer look you can tell it is definitely a temple of some sort
by the markings you see upon it.  From this distance you cannot see who the
temple is dedicated too, that would require you to get much closer.

From this distance you cannot make out who the temple is dedicated too
but you do notice someone or something at the gates of the temple.  It is
unmoving, and occupies the entire space in front of the only door in.

Name Vlad's Hideout~
Descr
You look around, having been transported here by Vlad, and find that you
are in a small room just large enough for everyone here.  You can feel the
energy floating about and decide that this would be a good place to rest.
