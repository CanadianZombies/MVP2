Name An Underground Courtyard~

You are in a courtyard lined with jewels and gold.  It looks as though
these zombies once enjoyed the sight of such riches.  Your guess is that the
necromancer decided to play god one day and take away their eyesight just to
see how they would react to not being able to see their riches.  Most of
them look sad and mopey now.  You wonder if the necromancer will ever give
them back their eyesight.  Then you wonder if he even remembers the zombies
at all.

From the looks of this room it seems as though the necromancer wanted his
creations to believe that they were in the real world.  It looks as though
this was used as a throne room for the a great king that once ruled before
the necromancer decided to play god and remove their eyesight.  The jewels
and riches in the walls make you think that the zombies loved to look at the
shiny stones and dream of wealth.

The stench of death fills the air within this small crypt. A metal
cauldron lies at the center of it. body parts mix with blood can be seen
boiling within it. A strange being can be seen beside it, reading from a
ancient tome. The Necromancer Guild Master, welcomes those who wants to join
it.
