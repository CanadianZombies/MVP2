Name A Secret Alcove Below the Sewers of Alteric~
Descr
Through the crack in Alteric's sewers lies a secret alcove. This place
appears to be inhabited by something, due to the strange footprints in the
dust covering the ground. One thing distinct about this small alcove is that
there are many rats scurrying everywhere.
